Job Description
Expertise in NLP, including analyzing text and generating new texts based on the analysis - must.
Expertise in solving predictive time series problems - advantage.
Knowledge in DS methodologies (e.g. CRISP-DM) and non-linear models (e.g. RNN and other deep learning models,
Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) - must.
Knowledge in languages and tools (SQL, Python/R) - must.
Experience in working with data warehouses, including joining several resources into one dataset - must.
Experience in automating DS models - advantage.
Knowledge in advanced languages and tools (BigQuery, Spark, Scala, Ruby, Java, etc.) - advantage.
Scope and Outcome:

Our project aims to improve traffic performance by creating an automatic and adaptive predicting model that incorporates both NLP and time series techniques.
Methodologies to be used: Natural Language Processing (NLP) - analyzing and tagging keywords (using models like word embedding, POS, etc.), and generating new keywords.
Time series - working with multi-streaming time series data where there is some dependency between the series.
Solving the problem with non-time series models (e.g. XGBoost) and with various advanced models of deep learning.
Tools to be used: Data science tools (R/Python),
Remote server tools (Linux, Rserver (if using R)),
Automating processes (Java/R/Python/Ruby)
