Our Focus
In aviation safety, we seek to minimize the potential for harm to the flying public. To support this
effort, we collect vast amounts of operational and simulation data. How can we use statistical
analyses and data science to analyze this data and effect meaningful change to aviation safety? If
this sounds interesting to you, GGTI seeks a Data Scientist to join its Data Science & Analytics Team.
What’s the Job?
· Preprocessing, cleansing, and verifying integrity of data that can be provided as input for
advanced analytics
· Ad-hoc analysis and presentations of results for technical and non-technical audiences
· Feature selection, model building and optimization using machine learning techniques
· Building regression, classification, association models
· Building anomaly detection systems
About You
You are an experienced Data Scientist with an advanced degree in a quantitative discipline. You will be able to discover information hidden in vast amounts of aviation data, including operation and simulated data, and provide recommendations to managements at various levels. Along with working with air traffic domain experts, you will be able to apply data mining techniques, perform statistical analyses, and build high quality predictive models and causal analyses of safety issues. You can analyze large, complex, multi-dimensional datasets with R and/or Python and Business Intelligence (BI) tools such as Tableau. In addition, you have some familiarity with SQL.
