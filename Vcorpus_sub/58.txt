• Should have data engineering and statistical modeling skills to conduct validation of credit models. (The models are mostly liner but some use advanced techniques like ensemble methods, gradient boosting and random forest.) • Should be able to code in python or R to replicate sensitivity analysis or model monitoring metrics. • Must have ability to test linear models using variable reduction techniques, conduct cross validation and tuning hyper-parameters. • Must have experience with Sci-kit learn and Pandas.
