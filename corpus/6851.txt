As a Data Scientist, you will evaluate and improve Skyline AI's machine learning algorithms. You will collaborate with a multi-disciplinary team of engineers and analysts on a wide range of problems. This position will bring analytical rigor and statistical methods to the challenges of measuring quality, improving consumer products, and understanding the behavior of end-users, advertisers, and publishers.

Skyline AI is and always will be an AI company. We hire people with a broad set of technical skills who are ready to take on some of technology's greatest challenges and make an impact on the trillion-dollar real estate market. At Skyline AI, data scientists not only revolutionize commercial real estate investments, they routinely work on massive scalability and storage solutions, large-scale applications and entirely new platforms for real estate investors around the world.

About Skyline AI

Skyline AI is an asset management technology company for commercial real estate. Skyline AI partners with leading commercial real estate firms to establish next-generation investment vehicles augmented by artificial intelligence. Mining data from over 130 different sources and applying advanced AI models to detect and exploit market anomalies, identify superior risk-reward investments, and discover untapped value-add opportunities, Skyline AI is a new, more precise way to invest in real estate. Founded in 2017, Skyline AI is backed by Sequoia Capital, JLL (NYSE: JLL), Nyca Partners and others. The company has offices in New York and Tel Aviv.

Responsibilities

Work with large, complex datasets. Solve difficult, non-routine analysis problems, applying advanced analytical methods as needed. Conduct end-to-end analysis that includes data gathering and requirements specification, processing, analysis, ongoing deliverables, and presentations.

Build and prototype analysis pipelines iteratively to provide insights at scale. Develop a comprehensive understanding of Skyline AI data structures and metrics, advocating for changes where needed for both products development and sales activity.

Interact cross-functionally with a wide variety of people and teams. Work closely with engineers to identify opportunities for, design, and assess improvements to Skyline AI's products.

Make business recommendations (e.g. cost-benefit, forecasting, experiment analysis) with effective presentations of findings at multiple levels of stakeholders through visual displays of quantitative information.

Research and develop analysis, forecasting, and optimization methods to improve the quality of Skyline AI's products; example application areas include real estate valuation modeling and live experiments.

Qualifications

PhD degree in a quantitative discipline as listed in Minimum Qualifications.

4 years of relevant work experience (e.g., as a statistician / computational biologist / bioinformatic / data scientist), including deep expertise and experience with statistical data analysis such as linear models, multivariate analysis, stochastic models, sampling methods. Analytical engagements outside class work while at school can be included.

Applied experience with machine learning on large datasets.

Experience articulating business questions and using mathematical techniques to arrive at an answer using available data. Experience translating analysis results into business recommendations.

Demonstrated skills in selecting the right statistical tools given a data analysis problem. Demonstrated effective written and verbal communication skills.

Demonstrated leadership and self-direction. Demonstrated willingness to both teach others and learn new techniques.
