Thanks for your interest in working at LeapYear.  

 
This is an overview of the problem we are solving, what we’ve done so far, and how you can get involved.  

 
LeapYear is a secure, automated machine learning platform for integrating, analyzing, and protecting sensitive data. 

 
Enterprises cannot safely leverage their data for analytics and machine learning because of security, privacy, and regulatory risks. LeapYear's technology enables enterprises to securely analyze and share sensitive data without exposing any confidential information. 

 
Unlike traditional methods which remove or obfuscate information, LeapYear enables analytics across all data elements and data sources with the highest standard of security and privacy. 

 
LeapYear is deployed with the world’s largest enterprises across healthcare, technology, and financial services, solving entrenched problems around operationalizing data. We have raised $12.6M in capital and contracted seven-figure annual recurring revenue from customers. LeapYear is backed by Bain Capital Ventures, Nyca Partners, Silicon Valley Bank, Bloomberg, and Peter Thiel.  

 
LeapYear has a strong culture of teaching, learning, and constant improvement. Our team includes senior executives from Fortune 500 companies as well as PhD-level cryptographers, researchers, and machine learning engineers with decades of experience with top organizations such as Google, Uber, MIT, and the US Department of Defense.  

 
We are advised by  Enrique Salem , former CEO of Symantec,  Hans Morris , former President of VISA, and world experts in security and machine learning.
