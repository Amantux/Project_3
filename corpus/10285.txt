The incumbent is a data-driven problem solver who understands and utilizes the Organization's strategies goals and processes to answer critical business and research questions by leveraging and synthesizing the large volume and variety of data available to them. Draws on tools and methods from statistics and machine learning to perform analysis, create predictive models, visualize data, and drive projects through to delivery. Continuously scans and tests new data sources, tools, and analytical techniques and partners with leading institutions and experts to contribute to our portfolio of next-generation analytic projects.

ESSENTIAL RESPONSIBILITIES

Work directly with diverse stakeholders to understand their questions, processes, programs and/ or initiatives, then identify how analytical solutions could help deliver value for them (e.g., more effective and/ or efficient processes, scientific insights). This includes leading on and being accountable for: outlining new use cases, estimating future impact, and identifying the necessary data elements to deliver the analytical solution to highly complex problems. Assemble that data set using knowledge of where the required data exist within the Organization's source data system, derived production sets or publicly available sources. Includes securing and overseeing appropriate access and documenting objectives, assumptions and processes

Select and apply the appropriate advanced modeling/machine learning techniques to these data-sets to deliver insight, ensuring that the final analysis is well researched, accurate, and documented. This requires technical flexibility and substantial expertise in, and delivery of: analytical approaches, including regression models, tree-based learning, neural networks, clustering techniques, natural language processing, including final model selection and advising on future maintenance

Consult with stakeholders to contextualize and translate the results of our analysis in an appropriate form for the project (e.g. actionable for the business, appropriate for scientific publication, appropriate for non-technical audience). This will include leading written reports, presentations and data visualizations, and draws clear lines between the high-level problem specifications, the analyses performed, and how the results link directly back to business or scientific objectives for highly complex problems. It requires the incumbent to demonstrate their depth of understanding of all areas of the industry, the data and the analytical methods through ongoing engagement with a range of audiences

Plan, prepare and deliver, coordinating all elements of the analysis of highly complex problems in such a way that it is delivered on time, to a high standard and ready to implemented on a production basis (including dissemination through the Organization's user systems) or published/presented in a scientific venue. This includes identifying the best route to the planned deliverable (e.g. implementation, publication) and coordinating fellow data scientists and analysts to deliver larger projects

Self-directed researching new analytical skills and approaches, building relationships internally and externally to transfer knowledge and maintain their position as subject matter experts (including a significant external profile such as presenting at / coordinating external events or publication in professional journals), coordinating fellow data scientists and analysts to guide analysis and deliver larger projects
