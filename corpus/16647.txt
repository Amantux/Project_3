The RoleThe position is to support daily data analytics activities and process improvements suggestions based on fleet data and known field returns for all cell programs with focus on cell production build issues. Candidate is expected to lead or support quality focused multidisciplinary cell-related projects, typically involving R&D, Design or Production organization. The engineer must be extremely organized, detail orientated, with strong ability to prioritize and multitask, successfully collaborate on projects with a range of business objectives. This person must exhibit the knowledge, leadership, and drive needed to not only challenge the status quo, but also define and execute the optimal path forward.Responsibilities* Perform extensive data study on all field failures and correlation studies with upstream cell manufacturing process. Create algorithms and test models to ensure proper detection and outlier rejection criteria for field rejects.* Identify trends from field return data and quantify reliability risks for diagnostics of key critical signals/metrics.* Create data visualizations to communicate analysis results with cross-functional teams and drive decision making of key failure modes on field.* Analyze Field Reliability/Quality data for cell related failures and failure modes to predict expected failure rates, affected populations, verify effectiveness of the corrective actions at Tesla and at suppliers.* Produce cogent and intelligible data visualizations, author technical presentations and summarize high-impact technical findings with strong data analysis package.Requirements* Experience in Big Data technologies SPARK* Strong SQL, Python queries for data analytics, applied knowledge of statistical analysis, time series analysis, working knowledge of reliability statistics such as Weibull Analysis* Strong data visualization skills Tableau/JMP* Excellent verbal and written communication skills - ability to break down complex technical topics and deliver visual technical presentations (e.g. PowerPoint) to groups of engineers, scientists, and technicians* B.S/M.S. in Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Materials Science or Data Science with 1-2+ years of industry experienceDesirable Attributes* Experience to recommend statistical/analytical models based on manufacturing data and process setup changes to improve quality of product* Quality control experience in test/manufacturing environment* Design of experiments for process optimization
