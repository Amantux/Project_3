Serve as the AFHSB’s principal expert for analyzing DoD and open source health surveillance data with the ultimate goal of predicting the onset of, and forecasting the further progression/ transmission of, military-relevant diseases of interest to the GCCs and the Military Services.

Communicate the results of such disease modeling and prediction efforts to senior leaders and public health decision-makers, clearly explaining the degree of uncertainty surrounding the results.

Disseminate the results of analytical studies by way of preparation of briefings, manuscripts, presentations, information summaries, issue papers, and technical documents, as well as their sharing via websites and other media outlets based on target audiences at the guidance of the IB section’s technical lead.

Work with Geographic Information System (GIS) experts to communicate the results graphically, where appropriate, through an interactive GIS-facilitated portal, to include, but not be limited to, the Health Surveillance Explorer or other disease assessment platforms available within the DoD or the USG interagency community at-large.

Collaborate with leaders in this field throughout the USG interagency and academia to ensure that DoD is using the most up-to-date techniques.

Develop advice on strategy in the field of disease modeling and prediction to interpret the landscape of available resources and programs and recommend future initiatives by the AFHSB.
