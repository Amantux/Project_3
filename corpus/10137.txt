Overview

AbleTo, Inc. is a market leader in providing technology-enabled behavioral health care. AbleTo has been treating patients for over six years, and improves patient outcomes and lowers costs by providing treatment that integrates behavioral and medical health care. AbleTo's structured therapy programs strengthen medical recovery and self-care among members with chronic or complex clinical needs. AbleTo analytics, coupled with our multi-channel engagement platform, identify and engage members with unmet, often undiagnosed, behavioral health needs. A proprietary platform connects individuals and their care teams with AbleTo licensed providers who deliver weekly sessions by phone or video supported by an integrated digital experience. AbleTo programs are clinically proven to improve both behavioral health and medical outcomes while lowering overall spending for higher-cost, higher-risk members. AbleTo's investors include .406 Ventures, Sandbox Industries, HLM Venture Partners, Horizon Healthcare Services, Inc., Bain Capital Ventures, Aetna Ventures, and Optum Ventures.

Data science at AbleTo is a hands-on function focused on capturing important signals from medical claims to predict high-cost patients with medical comorbidities and behavioral health needs. The team will also focus on enhancements to the models using pharmacy claims as well as socio-demographic data and other consumer data. Due to the complexity of health care, careful feature engineering is a key component in creating highly accurate and clinically valid models. The role requires someone passionate about utilizing predictive modeling to have an impact on health outcomes of our patients.
