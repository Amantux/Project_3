About The Team Data is at the core of Outreach's strategy. It drives our customers and ourselves to the highest levels of success. We use it for everything from customer health scores and revenue dashboards, to operational metrics of our AWS infrastructure, to helping increase product engagement and user productivity through automated natural language understanding, to predictive analytics and causal inference via experimentation. As our customer base continues to grow, we are looking towards new ways of leveraging our data to save our customers time and improve their sales efficiency. The mission of the Data Science team is to accelerate the success of our internal and external customers through trustworthy data analysis and experimentation. As a member of the team, you will be on the ground floor, working directly with the VP of Data Science to define and implement our strategy for delivering data products. You will be responsible for delivering models, data-driven functionality, and end-user features based on these models that will be deployed into production, as well as analyzing the data to produce actionable insights. Your Daily Adventures Will Include Analyzing huge volumes of communication such as e-mails and phone call transcripts Developing machine learning models and extracting insights and actions Implementing and testing prototypes on our large scale distributed data infrastructure Closely working with engineers to put your models and insights into production Working with internal teams to validate your results and enable them to take action based on your insights Rigorously measuring the impact of your work via data analysis and experimentation Our Vision of You You have a solid background in statistical learning techniques for NLP (Deep Learning, HMMs, CRFs, SVMs, LDA, LSI, MRFs, etc), and experience applying these techniques to solve real problems in one of the modern distributed ML and deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, MxNet, etc.) You have experience working with distributed data processing frameworks such as Spark You have strong programming skills in Python and are familiar with at least one other object oriented programming language (C++, Java, Scala, etc.) You understand the entire lifecycle of machine learning product development, from inception toproduction You are hands on, able to quickly pick up new tools and languages, and excited about building things and experimenting You go above and beyond to help your team You are honest, admit mistakes, and own fixing them You are a motivated and talented craftsperson: always looking to sharpen and adapt your skills You have an MS in Computer Science, Statistics, or a related quantitative field, or equivalent industry experience. PhD degree and a track record of publications at conferences such as NAACL, ACL, CoNLL, ICML, ICLR, IJCAI, SIGIR, EMNLP, KDD, WWW, NeurIPS, AAAI, CoLING are preferred Why You'll Love It Here • 100% medical, dental, and vision coverage for full-time employees • Unlimited PTO (and people actually use it!) • 401k to help you save for the future • Company-organized and personal paid volunteer days to support the community that supports us • Fun company and team outings because we play just as hard as we work • Diversity and inclusion programs that promote employee resource groups like OWN (Outreach Women's Network) • A parental leave program that includes not just extended time off but options for a paid night nurse, food delivery, gradual return to work, and the Gottman Institute's Bringing Home Baby course for new parents • Employee referral bonuses to encourage the addition of great new people to the team • Plus, unlimited snacks and beverages in our kitchen
