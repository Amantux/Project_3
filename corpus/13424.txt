At 605 we are engineers, analysts, data scientists, media experts, marketing strategists and political operatives. Our team of data scientists pioneered the field of TV data analytics. We offer unique, independent audience measurement and analytics to build better marketing and programming initiatives within the media and entertainment industries.

The Data Scientist role is a mid-level position in 605’s data science group, a technical and methodology-focused team within 605’s Product division. All analysts and data scientists at 605 share a knowledge of statistics and machine learning, R and/or python, and familiarity with relational databases and the scale/variety of 605’s data assets. In contrast to the more client-facing teams within the Product division (e.g., the Analytics team), the Data Science team brings to the table some deeper technical skills, including:
Hands-on experience with industry-standard predictive modeling solutions such as scikit-learn, xgboost, Spark ML, and H2O.ai in a production setting
Familiarity with diverse methods for supervised learning, unsupervised learning, ETL pipelines in general
A more nuanced understanding of cloud-based (Amazon Web Services) computing resources/infrastructure, especially the need for and methods of parallelization for analytics tasks
Experience in designing and implementing wrapper/tool/utility functions for automated tasks, to be used by less-technical Analytics team members, and organizing them into distributable, regularly maintained and tested R/python packages
Proficiency with source code management (git) and related code development/review workflows, as well as continuous integration tools like Travis or Jenkins
A data scientist will generally be involved in one or two projects at any given time, managed by the Senior Director of Data Science, and will work alongside other data scientists or analysts. Projects produce both client-facing deliverables as well as internal tools/datasets consumed by various teams at 605 (Analytics, Engineering, and Client Solutions).
