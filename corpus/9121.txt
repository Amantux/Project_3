Based in Palo Alto, California, Cardinal Analytx Solutions is a predictive analytics company that leverages machine learning and clinical expertise to help patients obtain better care, sooner. Most of healthcare today is very reactive – with care being delivered when someone is already ill. We believe that healthcare should be about keeping individuals and their families well – to prevent them from ever becoming sick. Building on years of published research from our founders at Stanford University, our mission is to give patients, providers, and payers the insights they need to improve patient health and prevent adverse medical events. Through machine learning and the extensive experience of our founders, team, and advisors in healthcare, we are committed to helping healthcare organizations see around the corner so that they can take a proactive approach to helping patients.
