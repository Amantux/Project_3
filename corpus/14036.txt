The Role

Want to build something new and exciting? Do you like building tools that can answer what demand might look like 6 months out for a particular product?

The Technology Organization (Product, Engineering and Data Science) at Thrasio is responsible for building the internal tools that will help ensure data quality and create opportunity for our great people here to quickly access data and make decisions related to growth of our brands (soon to be thousands of products) as we continue our goal of being the number one seller on Amazon.

In this role, you will be at the center of all the decision support for the company as we use the latest ML/DL and data science techniques to continuously optimize every aspect of the business, including inventory management, forecasting, lead gen analysis, keyword optimization and a whole new category of decision management for day to day operations.

Some of the day to day might include:
Owning the full Data Science life-cycle from conception to prototyping, testing, deploying, and measuring its overall business value
Developing quantitative models, leveraging machine learning and advanced data analysis techniques
Architecting and building technical platforms for our algorithmic engines to run at scale
Using data to improve the decision-making of everyone at Thrasio, and ultimately, to enhance the experience of our customers and our suppliers
Serving as a consultative partner to the marketing and creative teams to understand needs and conduct analyses that will help determine targeting strategy
Provide technical leadership and strategic initiatives for your team
Deliver presentations to high level business stakeholders that tell cohesive, logical stories using data - while this is primarily a technical role, we value the communication of ideas and want to expose data science to the company at large.
