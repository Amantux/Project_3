Connected Solutions, our newest division based to the Petcare group in NYC, is our newest hotbed for innovation, data, and analytics on all things Pets: care, nutrition, health and technology. We’re looking for a data scientist to partner with business leaders to understand and improve business performance. This role will work closely with stakeholders across the organization to create and deliver innovative insights that grow our business and fulfil our purpose of creating a better world for pets and pet owners.

The Team

The Petcare Connected Solutions Data & Analytics team is core to our Petcare strategy. We’re using digital, data and customer insights to transform our business by finding answers to problems that we’ve often never before asked ourselves. Our vast data assets – emerging innovation and technology such as WISDOM PANEL™ and WHISTLE® GPS dog tracker, traditional brands (Pet Nutrition, Royal Canin), Veterinary Services, and data from marketing, customers, pet owners etc. – are being combined to build a rich understanding of Pets and Pet Owners to power our business and the Petcare ecosystem. We are investing in the next generation of disruptors across the Petcare industry with programs like Leap Venture Studio, a venture fund supporting startups discovering innovation and enhancements of our data capabilities.

What you’ll do

This role will be key in helping our business understand the power of our data and how this translates into value for our company, Pet Owners and, most importantly, Pets. Frequently the projects will be ambiguous, but that’s part of the fun: you will determine the best way to leverage our data to tell the right story for any given audience.

In this role, you will also:

Apply data science approaches to understand and predict pets and pet owner behaviors

Use machine learning techniques, visualizations, statistical analysis, etc., to gain insight into various data sets – some readily available, and some you create and curate yourself (using technology such as Python, Pandas, Hadoop, Hive, or Spark)

Work closely and collaborate with internal and external teams across the business to ensure we focus on pet-centric product and service offerings

Support new pet technology businesses and partners by generating actionable insights from our data assets

Develop compelling stories that provide insight into the drivers of business performance and Pet/Pet Owner behavior

Who you are

Minimum 1 year of experience in a data science role handling varied and complex data

Truly inspired by, and want to live, our purpose of creating a better world for pets

Proficiency in machine learning modeling and statistical thinking (random forest, decision trees, supervised and unsupervised modeling, etc.)

Hands-on experience with Python is required; PySpark experience preferred

Comfortable with ambiguity, with a passion for collaboration to achieve objectives

Passion for growing and strengthening a business using data driven approaches

Enjoys explaining how models and systems work to both non-technical and technical stakeholders

A Bachelor’s degree in quantitative field (economics, statistics, business, computer science) or equivalent experience

So if you’ve got the skills we need and you’re looking for the opportunity to really make a mark in a world-renowned and supportive business going through a period of fast and massive digital transformation, this could be the role you’ve been waiting for.
