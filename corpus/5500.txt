Ref ID: 03900-0010884104 Classification: Business Analyst Compensation: $10,000.00 to $150,000.00 per year Robert Half is seeking an experienced Data Scientist to lead the development of a Data Science program at our Memphis facility. You will work closely with stakeholders to derive deep industry knowledge across paper, water, leather, and performance chemical industries. You will help develop a data strategy for the company including collection of the right data, creation of the data science project portfolio, partnering with external providers, and augmenting capabilities with additional internal hires. A large part of the job is communicating and developing relationship with key stakeholders and subject matter experts to tee up proofs of concept projects to demonstrate how data science can be used to solve old problems in unique and novel ways. You will not have a large internal team to rely on, at least initially, so individual expertise, breadth of data science knowledge, and ability to partner with external companies will be essential for success. In addition to the pure data science problems, you will be working closely with a multi-disciplinary team consisting of sensor scientists, software engineers, network engineers, mechanical/electrical engineers, and chemical engineers in the development, and deployment of IoT solutions. Requirements: Bachelor's degree in a quantitative field such as Data Science, Statistics, Applied Mathematics, Physics, Engineering, or Computer Science 5+ years of relevant working experience in an analytical role involving data extraction, analysis, and visualization and expertise in the following areas: Expertise in one or more programming languages R, Python, MATLAB, JMP, Minitab, Java, C++, Scala Key libraries such as Sklearn, XgBoost, GLMNet, Dplyr, ggplot, Rshiny Experience and knowledge of data mining algorithms including supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques areas such as Gradient Boosting, Decision Trees, Multivariate Regressions, Logistic regressions, Neural Network, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Time Series, Optimization Microsoft IoT/data science toolkit: Azure Machine Learning, Datalake, Datalake analytics, Workbench, IoT Hub, Stream Analytics, CosmosDB, Time Series Insights, PowerBI Data querying languages (e.g. SQL, Hadoop/Hive) and Preferred Qualifications A demonstrated record of success with a verifiable portfolio of problems tackled PLEASE SEND RESUMES TO [Click Here to Email Your Resum√©]
