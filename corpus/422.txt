Evidation Health is a new kind of health and measurement company that provides the technology and guidance to understand how everyday behavior and health interact. The volumes of behavior data generated from wearables and smartphones has opened up new ways to analyze individuals' behavior and health in real time. With a virtual pool of 3 million research participants, Evidation Health undertakes research for innovative biopharma and health care companies to transform how diseases are identified, treated, and monitored.

We're looking to fill multiple positions with outstanding applied scientists and engineers who want to use analytics and signal processing to understand and harness vast amounts of multi-variate time series data from connected wearables, sensors, and other mobile data in order to infer changes in health status and disease progression over time. The ideal candidates could have disciplinary training from several disciplines (machine learning, biostatistics, signal processing) and experience building models and applications from biomedical time series data.

We value problem-solving skills and an attitude towards learning: Our work lies at the intersection of many diverse fields including machine learning, signal processing, and epidemiology. We seek great communication and accountability, people who think people first.

If you thrive on autonomy and open-ended challenges, this is the perfect opportunity to take your career to the next level.

We have offices in San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Barbara, and are considering candidates for all three offices, as well as remote.
