Job Description

As businesses leverage digitalization opportunities, their cyber-attack surface structurally increases, which can lead to business disruptions, data breaches and brand damage. High profile industry incidents show that these risks are real, and this has turned cyber resilience into a topic for Boards.

Cyber attacks can cause damage to reputations, destruction of assets and loss of information. Shell is taking action to detect and respond to the continuous flow of these types of attacks.

As part of the Information Risk Management function, the CyberDefence capability has specific focus on identifying cyber threats, discovery of IT vulnerabilities, monitoring for cyber intrusions and response to security incidents.

As part of the CyberDefence capability the Threat and Analytics team in CyberDefence has two main areas of focus:

To ensure we understand the internal and external threat landscape, what threats to focus on and how these can be identified within Shell.

To find unknown cyber security threats active within Shell and weaknesses in our security controls by applying data analysis techniques to large, diverse sets of internal and external data.

Our Data Analysis team searches through large, diverse sets of internal and external data to detect any unknown cyber security threats that are active within Shell and weaknesses in our security controls. You will regularly come up with new hypotheses on how adversaries may be attacking us and will prove out your hypotheses based on Shell event data. Furthermore, you will use statistical and machine learning techniques to identify outliers that will be further investigated. Once the unknown becomes known, you will ensure that we automate our detection and hand it over to our 24x7 Monitoring team. The Data Analysis team is paramount to ensure we continuously improve our detection capabilities and keep track of the ever increasing threat landscape.
