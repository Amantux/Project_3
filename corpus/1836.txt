Scientist / Group Lead, Cancer Biology
Location: Cambridge, MA
We are seeking an energetic and self-motivated PhD scientist to join a team of scientists working towards discovery of unique anti-cancer compounds for the treatment of targeted patient populations. The candidate will be a highly creative cancer biologist with a strong desire to succeed at the highest level. This individual will lead drug discovery projects in a team environment and direct the activities of research associates under their supervision.
Principal Duties and Responsibilities
Independently design, execute and interpret cell based experiments to optimize compound selection and explore therapeutic potential of drug targets.
Lead drug discovery biology efforts to selection of lead candidate molecules and transition into clinical development
Design and develop cell and molecular assays to define mechanism of action for compounds, identify pharmacodynamic assays for utility in pre-clinical and clinical setting and test patient selection strategies
Utilize literature and internal genomics data sets to design and test hypothesis for drug targets
Interpret, present and report research findings at internal meeting an external scientific conferences
Manage and direct the activities of a group of research associates
Design strategies for cloning fusion reporter gene vectors, identify CROs to perform cloning and manage execution of the work.
Generated and maintain reporter cell lines
Perform viability assays, western blotting, and/or flow cytometry/FACS to analyze effect of small molecules on reporter expression
Validation of hits from high-throughput screens using medium-throughput plate based cellular assays, and high content cellular imaging assays. Strong understanding and hands-on experience with high content microscopy
Capability to develop, run and troubleshoot new assays in a high-throughput environment
Lead projects in the area of pooled cDNA or shRNA screens and NGS
Job Qualifications:
Ph.D equivalent in cell/molecular biology, Cancer Biology or genetics with 0-3 years industrial experience or MS with 10+ years of experience
Previous history of drug discovery with in Cancer Biology application
Experience with state of the art molecular biology methods and assays essential to drive projects such as transfection and transduction techniques and working with pooled cDNA or shRNA libraries
Experience developing multi channel FACS based screening assays
Proven track record for striving for high level of innovation and scientific excellence
Excellent management, training and education skills
Excellent interpersonal skills with a proven record of empowering world class science and energizing teams
Flexibility to accommodate to rapidly changing priorities and deadlines
Ability to work in a team-based environment
