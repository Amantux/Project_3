Job Title: Senior Data Scientist - Mobile Games

Reporting To: Senior Manager, Analytics

Department: Global Analytics, Player Science -Mobile

Location: Santa Monica, CA

Your Mission

The Activision Analytics team develops statistical services and tools to integrate into Activision's games and their operations. Examples include anomaly detection, recommendation systems, and computer vision. We work at the interface of design, big data engineering, and math to help deliver epic entertainment experiences.

The team is looking for another talented data scientist. As a member of the Analytic Services group, your main responsibility is to develop novel analytics and contribute to the vision and execution of Activision’s analytic strategy by creating innovative methodologies, algorithms and prototypes, and by demonstrating their value. You will build statistical models with large datasets to derive meaningful insights that effect actionable business decisions.

The ideal candidate will be a motivated statistician who wants to strengthen their statistical modeling skills in a fast-paced business environment and with a passion for video games. Because you also understand gamers' mindset, you are reliably able to qualitatively deduce and draw quantitative conclusions from player behavioral data that directly influence game design, play balance and player retention. If this sounds like it may be the perfect role for you, it probably is. Previous experience in the gaming industry is not required.

Drive exploration and analysis of large, complex data sets representing hundreds of millions of real-world play sessions. Establish the feasibility of critical studies, choosing the right tools and techniques to mine the data in a timely way, iterating on data visualizations, and draw quantitative conclusions from player data that directly influences game development. Some of your responsibilities may include:

Manage analytic projects and customer expectations

Effectively communicate with other members of the team to build and implement statistical models

Deliver presentations on analytic topics and results to both technical and non-technical audiences

Analyze gamer behavior and patterns to drive engagement strategies

Understand complex data attributes and constraints to develop efficient models

Engage in predictive model development, deployment, and performance tracking and validation

Work with game developers to identify key performance metrics and benchmarks related to user behavior, user segmentation, and user retention

Work closely with the live game teams to optimize play balance, game economies, and to identify and close out exploits

Mine current game data and user trends to inform the production of the next generation of products

Create models predicting key metrics like LTV for our portfolio of mobile titles

Evaluate and quantify the effects of ongoing changes to games through statistical methods
