About The Team

Data is at the core of Outreach's strategy. It drives our customers and ourselves to the highest levels of success. We use it for everything from customer health scores and revenue dashboards, to operational metrics of our AWS infrastructure, to helping increase product engagement and user productivity through automated natural language understanding, to predictive analytics and causal inference via experimentation. As our customer base continues to grow, we are looking towards new ways of leveraging our data to save our customers time and improve their sales efficiency.

The mission of the Data Science team is to accelerate the success of our internal and external customers through trustworthy data analysis and experimentation. As a member of the team, you will be on the ground floor, working directly with the VP of Data Science to define and implement our strategy for delivering data products. You will be responsible for delivering models, data-driven functionality, and end-user features based on these models that will be deployed into production, as well as analyzing the data to produce actionable insights.

Working with internal and external customers to understand their pain points and brainstorm solutions

Designing A/B testing experiments and doing end-to-end data analysis to understand user experience and propose improvements.

Working alongside experienced engineering, design, and product teams to help deliver new customer-facing features and products.
