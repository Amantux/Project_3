Blucora has a bold aspiration: we are committed to giving all people the tools needed to lead healthy financial lives - tools often reserved for the wealthy.

We began our journey by bringing together two industry-leading firms to form a foundation in tax-smart investing that is unreplaceable in the industry. TaxAct is an innovative tax software company that helps more than 4 million Americans prepare their own taxes each year. HD Vest is the first firm in the world to make it possible for tax professionals to support clientsâ€™ wealth management needs (now over $45B for more than 300,000 Americans).

We now turn to the next leg, developing the technological tools that make our vision of financial health for all a reality. Atypical for the financial services industry, we take a contemporary approach to strategy and product development that is founded in user insights, rapid testing and a singular focus on driving end-user value.

Since charting new territory on a daily basis is part of everyone's job at Blucora, we've attracted team members who thrive on the challenge, encourage each other, and are passionately committed to the goal. If you agree that problem- solving is a team sport, and feel energized by a good debate, deep dive research, or a fun night out with colleagues, we might be the right firm for you!
