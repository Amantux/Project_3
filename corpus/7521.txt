Social Data Scientist

The Challenge:  
Are you excited at the prospect of unlocking the secrets held by a data set? Are you fascinated by applying social science theory to solve complex analytical problems? In an increasingly connected world, massive amounts of structured and unstructured data open up new opportunities. As a social scientist, you can turn these complex data sets into useful information to solve global challenges. Across private and public sectors — from fraud detection, to cancer research, to national intelligence — you know the answers are in the data. 

We have an opportunity for you to use your analytical skills to improve the lives of service members across the DoD. You’ll work closely with your customer to understand their questions and needs, and then dig into their data-rich environment to find the pieces of their information puzzle. You’ll write scripts, build predictive analytics, use automation, design survey questions, apply social science theory and research, and use the right combination of tools and frameworks to turn that set of disparate data points into objective answers to help military leaders make informed decisions. You’ll provide your customer with a deep understanding of their data, what it all means, and how they can use it. Join us as we use data science for good to prevent sexual assault in the military. 

Empower change with us.
