Applecart deploys proprietary technology to run marketing campaigns that leverage positive customer word-of-mouth on behalf of brands. Last year we closed a $6 million funding round, led by global sports and entertainment leader Endeavor (with Endeavor CEO Ari Emanuel joining Applecart’s board) and other prominent tech investorsincluding Aspect Ventures, former Yelp SVP of Engineering Michael Stoppelman, and Infinite Computer Solutions founder Sanjay Govil.

Applecart has recently expanded into a second vertical with the goal of building a game-changing, direct-to-consumer, two-sided marketplace that will empower and compensate customers who refer their personal networks to brands and products that they genuinely love. We give brands the ability to tap into a new scalable and cost-effective customer acquisition channel: peer-to-peer referrals via the networks of their current, satisfied customers. Our marketplace helps great brands efficiently grow beyond traditional marketing channels to generate a high volume of sales via genuine and positive word-of-mouth from existing customers.

Your work will inform both the advertising outcomes for our enterprise clients, as well as, the experience of the consumers and success of the brands on our marketplace.

Qualifications:

5+ years of professional data science experience

Expertise building data products from scratch

Proven track record leading multiple mid-level data scientists (with 2+ years experience), providing technical guidance and modeling best practices in engineering

Expert knowledge with recommendation systems and supervised learning

Superior ability to write high quality code (OOP, unit tests, decorators etc)

Experience developing, monitoring and maintaining consumer facing data products

Ability to prototype quickly with close-to-production quality code

Skilled in communicating highly technical content to a nontechnical audience

Preferred Qualifications:

Previous experience building large data science products from scratch and maintaining through the entire software development lifecycle at a growth-stage startup

Startup experience (or equivalent ability to deliver despite ambiguous requirements)
