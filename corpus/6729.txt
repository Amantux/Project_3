About Rev:

Rev is a marketplace for remote work made up of a large network of 22,000 freelancers (aka Revvers) that provide services to our 100,000+ customers around the world including companies like Amazon, Google, Buzzfeed and more. Our goal is to create 100,000 work-from-home jobs by 2020, and we are looking for ambitious professionals to help us get there.

Started by MIT engineers in 2010, Rev has raised capital from Silicon Valley VC's. We have 85 employees (and growing) with offices in San Francisco and Austin. Sales are growing fast, and we reached profitability in 2017. We like to hire people that are intelligent, humble, high achievers and are eager to advance their careers. You'll be measured on your impact rather than your effort.

Today, we offer four services and we will launch more in the next few years. Our initial offerings are audio transcription, video captions, document translation, and mobile on-demand math tutoring. What the verticals have in common is the work can be done anywhere, and software can transform them, via marketplace methods, productivity improvements, and machine learning. We believe many types of work can be done remotely, and we have a game plan to change more of them in the years to come.
