BWXT is currently seeking a flexible, multi-talented process engineer and Data Scientist to serve as the lead process qualification researcher using data-driven, automated, and machine learning methods in to join the Advance Technologies Group in Lynchburg, VA. This role allows for opportunities in reactor design research, inspection methods, deployment of data collection sensors and instrumentation, statistical data interpretation, data mining, visualization and image processing.

Job Description/Duties:

Establishes experiments, measurements and datasets/databases to statistically assess for variation, repeatability, reproducibility as the foundation for qualifying new development processes and transferring to production environment.

Works with established quality assurance procedures to assess requirements for new processes.

Qualifies new techniques applied to nuclear manufacturing for propulsion and power, radioisotope production for medical diagnostics and additive manufacturing processes.

Leads development teams through the qualification process, relying on subject matter experts of the process while deploying a range of data science techniques as appropriate to structured and unstructured data.

Uses neural networks, multi variable regression, structured hypothesis testing and quantitative confidence assessments, probability and sample size.

Establishes supporting databases for systematic review and quantitative assessment. Integrate sensors, interrogate, clean and integrate data.

Participates in development of data engineering platforms and frameworks making use of historical data sets or collected via instrumentation of nuclear medicine production processes. Develop and/operate partner compute systems using parallel and/or GPU processing.

Lends data science expertise to other BWXT projects across the enterprise from ideation and scoping to commercialization that include power systems, complex chemical processing, and computer vision.

Satisfies research and development objectives to warrant continued investment toward product realization, both as research investigator creating new innovations and as support to engineering to build and maintain automated process line equipment.

Job Qualifications/Requirements:

A minimum of a Bachelor’s Degree in a technical or computational field of study (e.g., Mechanical Engineering, Nuclear Engineering, Biostatistics) is required. Engineering Degree must be from an ABET-accredited university.

A minimum of 15 years of experience with biostatistical, nuclear, or medical quality is required, however, an advanced degree may substitute for some years of experience. A Master's Degree employing multi-variable, multi-variate regression techniques and machine learning methods is preferred. Area of scientific or engineering education augmented by computational experience preferred.

Must possess design of experiment expertise, process variation and statistical analytics, coding skills to automate reports and analysis as well as to develop new platforms.

Experience with nuclear, mechanical, and/or medical qualification processes (NRC, ASME, FDA, ISO) required. Experience with Monte Carlo simulation (esp MCNP), nuclear qualification processes such as ASME N-stamp preferred.

Root causes analyses required, Six Sigma black belt or master black belt preferred, especially with projects focused on quantitative analytics, coding in C++, C, Python, R, Visual Basic and/or equivalent analytical programming, as well as database management skills.

Must be a US Citizen with no dual citizenship.

Must be able to obtain and maintain a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) clearance.

US Citizenship, with no dual citizenship is required for this position.

Applicants selected will be subject to a Federal background investigation and must meet eligibility requirements for access to classified information or matter. Position requires U.S. Citizenship with (no dual citizenship) ability to obtain and maintain a Department of Energy (DOE) security clearance which involves an extensive criminal and financial background investigation, drug test and previous employment reference verifications.
