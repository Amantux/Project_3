The Hadlock lab at the Institute for Systems Biology (ISB) is seeking a Software Engineer or Data Scientist to implement innovative data science solutions. Our lab focuses on two areas of investigation: risk modeling for clinical decision support and improved patient outcomes, and new data science approaches to accelerate biomedical discovery. We have rare access to one of the largest collections of comprehensive electronic health records (EHRs) in the world, with longitudinal data for over 4,000,0000 patients from 50 hospitals across seven states. We also work with high-fidelity data from prospective studies that combine genomics, imaging, health-related social needs, and patient-reported outcomes.Our team collaborates with computer scientists, data scientists, systems biologists and physicians across the country. Current projects include pre-hospital risk prediction for sepsis, investigating neural imaging and biomarkers in adolescent behavioral health, and applying domain-agnostic similarity metrics to discover patterns in semi-structured EHR data. We are looking for an individual who is enthusiastic about rapid, early phase discovery of novel insights, and has the desire to design and implement open source tools for researchers worldwide. This position offers significant opportunities for growth and career advancement.
