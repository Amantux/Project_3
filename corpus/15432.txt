Hello potential future Oatly employee. It’s us, the original oatmilk company that started in Sweden back 25 or so years ago and has since expanded to the U.S. where we’ve continued growing at a rate such that we need more brilliant minds to come work with us to keep the momentum going and the oatmilk flowing.
Sustainability, health, and transparency are the core values that guide everything we do. Basically, we exist to make it easy for people to eat better and live healthier lives without recklessly taxing the planet’s resources in the process. If any of this resonates with you, then maybe you’d like work for Oatly, too. Now onto the formal stuff.
We are looking for an experienced Food Scientist / Product Development Engineer to join our team. This position will manage product development initiatives to support new product development/innovation. The role will report to our US Product Development Lead.
Here are the things we want to hire you to do:
Project manage technical development projects focusing on product development, process, and product care to help Oatly improve and launch more innovative food and beverage products
Lead and document development projects all the way from brief, to launch, and follow-up according to Oatly’s product development process, current operating systems and procedures
Provide data and documentation for manufacturing and quality control
Plan and carry out development work in lab and pilot scale
Design, develop, and lead tests to qualify new products and to support changes to existing products
Plan and participate in factory trial both internally and with external production partners
Perform different types of analyses to ensure food quality and specifications to support operational launch and scale
Responsible for development projects being conducted in accordance with applicable legislation and other regulations, and ensuring that ingredients and products fulfill company standards
Comfortable traveling 20% - 25% of the time
Here are things we think you need:
MS preferred: Chemical Engineering, Food Engineering or Food Science degree with 10+ years of experience
Background in process development and commercialization of aseptic processes and/or support of manufacturing operations is required. Preference for dairy &/or dairy alternative product processing
Proven track record of leading product development projects including timeline development/management, testing / trials, operational launch and scale
Ability to listen to others needs and identify technical solutions
Ability to refine those solutions and manage internal and external partner’s expectations against technical and business success criteria with limited available resources
Demonstrated resourcefulness, creativity, critical thinking, and problem solving skills
Naturally curious with a constant pursuit to create improvements
And here’s another list of qualities we think make a good Oatly team member:
You feel connected to our mission of encouraging health, sustainability, and transparency
You are a self-starter who doesn’t need direct supervision to motivate you for success – we believe strongly in building a culture of individual accountability and ownership and need partners that can embrace that mentality
You are ready to make your mark in a smaller, growing brand leveraging your experience to deliver amazing results and build an outstanding company
You have entrepreneurial spirit in that you’re comfortable with ambiguity and are energized by the process of building something lasting from the ground up
You enjoy sharing your quirkiness and talents with your coworkers
Another bulleted list felt redundant, so we wrote this long sentence with all the ways we sweeten the deal to work with us, like providing 20 days paid vacation for starters, really great benefits with 100% medical coverage, genuinely great coworkers who want to see the company and each other succeed, a start-up vibe with an established company history, and a fridge full of the best non-dairy alternative in the world for your enjoyment.
