Join the Spark Team

We were born of innovation, springing from the curiosity, imagination and dedication of remarkable scientists and healthcare visionaries. Our shared mission is to challenge the inevitability of genetic disease by discovering, developing, and delivering treatments in ways unimaginable – until now.

We don’t follow footsteps. We create the path.
Summary
The downstream process development and formulation (DSPD) team is seeking a highly motivated and creative process scientist to support high-throughput process development of downstream operations. A successful candidate will use state-of-the-art robotic and liquid-handling technologies to automate current workflows, design and interpret high-throughput experiments to develop downstream unit operations, and translate work at a conventional column scale. All work will be in support of Spark Tx’s next-generation AAV modalities and leading gene-therapy pipeline. The candidate must have laboratory experience in process development of chromatography and filtration operations and liquid handling (i.e. programming of TECAN, Beckman, or Hamilton). Experience with multivariate statistics (DOE) and programming (especially Visual Basic, MATLAB, or Python) is preferred.

The major responsibilities include, but are not limited to:

• Develop liquid-handling applications to automate current downstream process-development activities

• Create software for analysis of high-throughput, multivariate datasets

• Use high-throughput and conventional methods to develop downstream operations

• Participate in strategic planning of downstream process development activities in support of project lifecycles
