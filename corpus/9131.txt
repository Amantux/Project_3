Global Talent Management (GTM) is centrally responsible for creating and evolving Amazon’s human capital and talent programs and processes.

People Science Team within GTM is a growing start-up team with direct impact on Amazonians across all of our businesses and locations around the world. We play a crucial role in ensuring top notch data products and insights facilitate our growth and development of talent in intelligent and curious ways. We regularly use data to pitch ideas and drive conversations with Amazon’s Senior Vice President of HR and other executives about how to improve existing talent programs to solve organizational problems focused on (but not limited to) talent differentiation, talent movement, employee-role matching, product integration, promotion practices, organization design and succession planning, and diversity and inclusion, or invent new ones that address the evolving needs of our diverse employee base.

You develop innovative and even frighteningly bold plans and ideas to discover new ways to advance our goals. You will be expected to be a thought leader as we chart new courses with our rapidly growing employee populations, and lead the way in experimenting new ideas that have not yet been explored.

Successful candidates will have a deep knowledge of computing statistical and machine learning methods for large scale prediction problems -or- a deep knowledge of computational optimization methods and mathematical modelling, the ability to map models into production-worthy code, the communication skills necessary to explain complex technical approaches to a variety of stakeholders and customers, and the excitement to take iterative approaches to tackle big, long term problems.
