Overview

We accelerate scientific discoveries by providing innovative sample collection devices and scalable services centered around 'omics profiling, with a particular focus on the trillions of microbes that live in and around us. We seek R&D Data Scientists to join a team of highly motivated, passionate, and collaborative bioinformaticians and data scientists. If you're looking for a position that will drive innovation in microbiome science and multi-'omic analysis and lead to discovery, our organization is for you.

We are built upon innovation, and we will look to you for bold ideas and fresh insights to fuel further innovation. You will collaborate with team members across our organization to identify best-in-class methods for microbiome and multi'omic analyses, develop novel solutions for 'omics data analysis, analyze data to support internal R&D efforts, and generate manuscripts, white papers, and scientifically-rooted, data-driven materials to support marketing efforts. Data analysis approaches developed by the R&D informatics team will support our product development activities and feed directly into newly expanding service offerings for our customers across pharma, nutrition, live therapeutics development, agriculture, and academic organizations. You will be responsible for providing expert advice on novel 'omics analysis approaches, data integration and manipulation, and pattern discovery techniques. Experience in a fast-paced environment and passion for data, microbiome research, microbial genomics, and/or multi-'omics research are key traits that characterize the members of our team.

Responsibilities

Team members who fill Data Scientist roles in this team will be responsible for creating and implementing strategies for data integration and for the analysis and visualization of multi-'omic data sets while using best practices in reproducible research and cloud-based computing. Successful applicants will work collaboratively within the R&D informatics team and across our organization. In this position you will work with our microbiome services team, software engineering team, and wet-lab R&D teams to lead innovation in microbiome and multi'omic research, services, and products.

Specific efforts will include:
Implementing high-quality and state-of-the art data science and computational biology approaches to the analysis of multi-'omic data
