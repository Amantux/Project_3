Job Description

Intel invites you to join the team that develops and implements Resolution Enhancement Techniques that assist the successful pattern transfer from mask to wafer in a sub-wavelength imaging regime and enable the manufacture of every Intel silicon product. This team resides at the critical interface between Design and Manufacturing at Intel and enables the first step in silicon manufacturing. It's operations transform the chip design to generate data for photomask fabrication and wafer inspection. This data transformation is at the cross roads of VLSI Design, Photomask Technology, Photolithography, and High Performance Computing.

What you'll do:

In this position you will perform numerical modeling, computational simulation, layout manipulation, correction algorithm development using scientific software tools written specifically for these purposes. You will utilize knowledge of state-of-the-art principles and theories in photolithography, optics, modeling, and software engineering to investigate potential new technologies 2-4 years prior to being applied to product. This highly specialized and complex work requires the acquisition, handling, vetting and analysis of very large data-sets; involves all aspects of process flow and methodology development including: requirements gathering, functional specification, scientific programming, quality assurance, technical approval, and coordination of massive distributed data processing operations.

The successful candidate is both detail and results oriented, relies on sound engineering judgment, and has solid data analysis, critical thinking, and presentation skills to arrive at timely solutions for complex and highly constrained problems. This opportunity is intensely collaborative & requires the continuous interaction with fellow group members and adjacent engineering teams, to absorb an in depth understanding of technology design rules, discover integrated requirements, and negotiate with internal customers to identify optimal solutions in a dynamic environment. The successful candidate will need to continue their education in this fascinating and multi-disciplinary field and expects to continuously encounter and overcome problems with root cause solutions. Does this sound like you?

This is an entry level position and will be compensated accordingly.
