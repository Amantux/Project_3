About Us

At Cloudflare, we have our eyes set on an ambitious goal: to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the world's largest networks that powers more than 10 trillion requests per month. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare have all web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was recognized by the World Economic Forum as a Technology Pioneer and named to Entrepreneur Magazine's Top Company Cultures list.

We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!

About the Department

About the Role

We are looking for Data Scientists to join our Detection and Response team to build advanced threat detection capabilities, and to automate security operations. You will train and deploy Machine Learning (ML) models for anomaly detection, user & entity behavioral analysis, and SIEM automation. The role requires experience in statistics, data science and interest in cyber security.

What you'll do

Understand complex distributed systems and business processes, and work with security engineers to build their threat models

Analyze and transform large datasets for feature engineering, labeling and improve data fidelity

Build anomaly detection engines with unlabeled and semi-labelled datasets based on threat models and abuse scenarios

Work with threat researchers and security engineers to understand Incident Response process, and improve the process with predictive data modeling

Train and deploy statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models

Continuously monitor the performance of models though active learning or similar processes, and strive to improve model efficacy

Examples of desirable skills, knowledge and experience

M.S. or Ph.D. in Computer Science, applied mathematics, or a related engineering discipline

4+ years of industry experience in analyzing large datasets, modeling and machine learning algorithms

Experience in high level programming languages like Python (Numpy, Scipy, Pandas)

Experience with Spark, SQL, Tableau, Google Analytics, Hive and BigQuery (or any other Big data/Cloud equivalent) etc.

Familiar with the challenges of collecting, processing and labelling large datasets, preferably in the Security domain.

What Makes Us Special

We're not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We're a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo ( https://blog.cloudflare.com/protecting-free-expression-online/ ): We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare's enterprise customers--at no cost.

Project Athenian ( https://www.cloudflare.com/athenian/ ): We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

Path Forward Partnership ( https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/path-forward/ ): Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

1.1.1.1 ( https://1.1.1.1/ ): We released1.1.1.1 ( https://1.1.1.1/ ) to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here's the deal - we don't store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by ourprivacy policy ( https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/commitment-to-privacy/privacy-policy/privacy-policy/ ) and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

Sound like something you'd like to be a part of? We'd love to hear from you!
