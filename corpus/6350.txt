Read what people are saying about working here. 

6,000 people dedicated to discovery - 6 research campuses across the globe. As a Data Scientist (Investigator II / III) you will be a part of this great community working to enable the next breakthrough in innovative medicines for patients in need. You will be at the forefront of life sciences, tackling some incredible challenges that are curing diseases and improving patients’ lives.

As a member of the Scientific Data Analysis team, you will explore and develop machine learning and other advanced analysis approaches to drive drug discovery towards novel innovative medicines. Together with wet-lab scientists and other computational colleagues, you will identify tractable machine learning problems in all stages of drug discovery from disease biology mechanistic understanding, to therapeutic target identification, assay development, safety, and patient stratification. In your role, you will work with drug discovery teams from many different disease areas as part of a large community of hundreds of data scientists in NIBR and Novartis.

You will frame key questions, define appropriate data sets, perform data analysis, or train machine learning models to ultimately address key scientific needs for projects. You will collaborate closely with bench scientists, software engineers, statisticians and bioinformaticians to make sense of high-dimensional pre-clinical and clinical data. This will require you to deploy cutting-edge data science techniques on a wide variety of different data types in order to enable drug discovery teams to succeed. As a successful candidate, you must demonstrate the ability to work collaboratively, to communicate well, and to deliver actionable results.
