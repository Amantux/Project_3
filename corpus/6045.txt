Description

The Public Safety Lab at New York University is looking for a full-time data scientist to build and

oversee a large-scale automated crawl of daily criminal justice data. You will: generate and

deploy scripts to crawl online jail rosters on a daily basis for approximately 1,000 facilities;

create a scheduler to run each script for each location each day; create and provide a data

storage environment for jail crawl content; create a dashboard that monitors the success of

crawls and identifies errors; adjust jail crawl scripts experiencing errors; generate and deploy

scripts to crawl criminal case records from available sites; provide a data storage environment

for criminal case crawl content; and support the merging of jail and criminal case records using

probabilistic matching strategies. We require candidates to have either experience

programming in relevant environments or a degree in information systems/computer science.

Significant skills working with Python and AWS are a plus.

The Public Safety Lab, launched in 2017, applies the tools of data science and social science to

the project of criminal justice reform. For example, many relatively minor offenses are easy to

detect and interdict. Many more serious offenses are much harder to detect and interdict. As a

consequence we may overpunish relatively minor offenses, and underpunish more serious

offenses. The Public Safety Lab works with both confidential and publicly accessible data to

identify strategies that minimize both overpunishment and underpunishment.

For more information about the Public Safety Lab see www.publicsafetylab.org.

Qualifications

Required education: undergraduate degree in information technology or computer science

Required experience: significant knowledge of and experience with programming in Python,

AWS architecture, web crawling

Preferred education: master's degree in information systems/information technology,

computer science, or data science is a plus.
