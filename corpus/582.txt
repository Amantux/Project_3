I0756P Applications Professional II

Job-Specific Responsibilities

Our group in the Department of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School is looking for an innovative and enthusiastic team member to join a growing multidisciplinary research laboratory. We are interested in understanding how computations arise from the organization and connectivity of neuronal networks. To analyze neural circuit structure and function at highest resolution and completeness possible, we combine high-throughput electron microscopy (EM) with in vivo two-photon calcium imaging. We are looking for a data scientist/engineer capable of developing software, working with custom-built instrumentation for high-throughput EM, and handling and analyzing large data.

The main projects include:

1) development and application of machine learning approaches at scale for image segmentation and analyses

2) large data handling

3) development of an automated platform for serial section TEM using a novel substrate

4) development and validation of an automated transmission electron microscope (TEM) with a high-speed camera array

5) development and validation of a high-throughput multi-photon microscope for volumetric in vivo imaging.

The development will require a close working collaboration with biologists expert in TEM operation, EM sample preparation, and the design requirements of the projects. Building this novel software and hardware will play a vital role in helping us achieve our biological aims. Typical duties of the Functional Connectomics Engineer include: developing software to analyze large-scale image datasets; computational systems oversight and miscellaneous programming; developing custom-designed electron-optical, optical, mechanical, and electronic instruments; novel collection substrate preparation; EM sample preparation; communicating with vendors and coordinating jobs with internal and external service providers and collaborators; documenting projects and communicating project progress.

Typical Core Duties

Participate fully in software development life cycle

Support technical solutions to deliver business requirements

Troubleshoot problems and suggest improvements to coding practices

Act as technical liaison to internal clients

Abide by and follow the Harvard University IT technical standards, policies and Code of Conduct

Basic Qualifications

Minimum of two years' post-secondary education and/or relevant work experience

Additional Qualifications

Bachelor's Degree in computer science, engineering, life or physical sciences or a related discipline preferred. 2 years of related experience in research or related environment. Advanced degree may count toward experience. Demonstrated experience in software and instrumentation development. Proficiency in at least one programming language including, but not limited to, Python or MATLAB.

We are especially interested in candidates with: - an advanced degree in science or engineering - highly proficient in Python - programming experience in other languages (e.g., C, Java, MATLAB) - experience with machine learning, deep learning, and convolutional neural networks - experience with nano-positioning systems - experience with electron microscopy and electron-optics - experience with non-linear (multi-photon) optics and laser scanning microscopy - work experience in biomedical research and/or an academic science environment - demonstrated experience teaching or training in an informal setting. The successful candidate will be self-motivated, creative, and enjoy working in a dynamic and intellectually stimulating environment. S/he will be skilled at translating research problems into well-defined technical specifications and then designing and building user-friendly software solutions and instrumentation; s/he will have excellent interpersonal skills; enthusiasm for collaborating closely with biologists; software, engineering, and data science skills; and the ability to write clearly for a broad audience.

Certificates and Licenses

Completion of Harvard IT Academy specified foundational courses (or external equivalent) preferred

Working Conditions

Work is performed in an office setting

Additional Information

This is a 12-month term position, renewable contingent on funding.

Harvard offers an outstanding benefits package including:

Time Off: 3 - 4 weeks paid vacation, paid holiday break, 12 paid sick days, 11.5 paid holidays, and 3 paid personal days per year.

Medical/Dental/Vision: We offer a variety of excellent medical plans, dental & vision plans, all coverage begins as of your start date.

Retirement: University-funded retirement plan with full vesting after 3 years of service.

Tuition Assistance Program: Competitive tuition assistance program, $40 per class at the Harvard Extension School and discounted options through participating Harvard grad schools.

Transportation: Harvard offers a 50% discounted MBTA pass as well as additional options to assist employees in their daily commute.

Wellness options: Harvard offers programs and classes at little or no cost, including stress management, massages, nutrition, meditation, and complementary health services.

Harvard access to athletic facilities, libraries, campus events and many discounts throughout metro Boston.

The Harvard Medical School is not able to provide visa sponsorship for this position.
