Our customers consume billions of hours of content per month on a myriad of devices, and business continues to grow rapidly as we focus on penetrating key international markets.In 2019, we spent $12 billion on films, TV shows, and other exciting content, much of which will be branded Netflix Originals. As we venture to become the world's greatest movie studio, we must successfully develop studio tools that will keep us nimble and effective. To that end, our organization is fast-growing and is a critical part of the business.This area owns all applications built internally to assist various Netflix Content finance teams, and we are looking for a senior data analyst to support our finance team. Leaning on a consistent record in customer support with large-scale enterprises, we expect this role to drive our efforts to support a suite of apps that handle the company's content spend (covering programming, budgeting and forecasting, deal tracking, payments, accounting, and financial reporting).
