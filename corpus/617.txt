Overview

Intuit is seeking a Staff Data Scientist to join our AI futures team in Mountain View, CA.

The Tech futures develops game changing technologies and experiments that redefine and disrupt our current product offerings. You’ll be building and prototyping algorithms and applications on top of the collective financial data of 60 million consumers and small businesses. Applications will span multiple business lines, including personal finance, small business accounting, and tax.

You thrive on ambiguity and will enjoy the frequent pivoting that’s part of the exploration. Your team will be very small and team members frequently wear multiple hats.

In this position you will have close collaboration with the Tech Futures Group engineering and design teams, as well as the product and data teams in business units. Your role will range from research experimentalist to technology innovator to consultative business facilitator. You must be comfortable partnering with those directly involved with big data infrastructure, software, and data warehousing, as well as product management.
