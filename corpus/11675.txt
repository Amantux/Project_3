What you'll do A Staff Data Scientist is responsible for analyzing large data sets to develop multiple custom models and algorithms to drive innovative business solutions. Staff Data Scientists work on large project teams in order to provide analytical support and guidance to an assigned area on for large projects (for example, email targeting, business optimization, consumer recommendations) within Walmart eCommerce. Staff Data Scientists are responsible for building large data sets from multiple sources in order to build algorithms for predicting future data characteristics. Those algorithms will be tested, validated, and applied to large data sets. Staff Data Scientists are responsible for training the algorithms so they can be applied to future data sets and provide the appropriate search results. Staff Data Scientists are responsible for researching new trends in the industry and utilizing up-to-date technology (for example, HBase, MapReduce, LAPack, Gurobi) and analytical skills to support their assigned project. Minimum Qualifications Experience with deep learning techniques like CNN, RNN, LSTM, etc. Understanding of Deep Reinforcement Learning Build complex data sets from multiple data sources, both internally and externally. Build learning systems to analyze and filter continuous data flows and offline data analysis. PhD in computer science or similar field with 3+ years of experience • Highly proficient in Python or Java • Extremely hands-on in building Machine Learning products • Experience in building data products and crunching terabytes of data • A good portfolio of machine learning projects with a significant impact on the bottom line • Experience in working as a tech lead • Blog posts, papers or conference talks showing your involvement in the community Preferred Qualifications • Familiarity with Deep Learning
