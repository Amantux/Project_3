Who are we looking for?

The Geographic Data Science Group in the National Security Emerging Technology (NSET) Division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) seeks to hire a talented data scientist to support pioneering algorithm research and development that utilizing spatial and spatio-temporally referenced data.

Who are we?

Born in secrecy under the Manhattan project of World War II, ORNL has emerged as the U.S. Department of Energy’s largest open science and energy laboratory. Innovation at ORNL is powered by literally thousands of top tier scientists, engineers, and technicians with access to world class facilities including the world’s fastest supercomputer (Summit). We are engaging in open, peer reviewed, interdisciplinary research cross cutting multiple application domains from neutrons to biology, from nuclear to manufacturing, and nanophase to national security.

What will you be doing?

As a data scientist in the Geographic Data Science Group, you will have the opportunity to work on challenging, multi-disciplinary projects that advance data science methods, workflows, and systems under problems motivated by national security challenges. You will have the opportunity to work with a talented team, expand your skills, publish your findings, and leverage the expertise of a wide network of scientists.

This particular position focuses on geographic data science which refers to the processing, linking, modeling, and exploitation of remote sensing, imagery, social media, population, text, global open source data, and many others in order shed light on the human and physical landscapes that shape our national security posture. Applications range from detecting and modeling the built environment (e.g. emerging mega cities) at unprecedented spatial scales (sub-meter) to mining major geopolitical trends and patterns that set the stage for progress or for violence. These methods are rolled out as solutions that directly impact capabilities in national defense, emergency management, agricultural and urban resiliency, infrastructure security, and human dynamics. Methods include but are not limited to artificial intelligence, data mining, uncertainty quantification, hierarchical data modeling, model parameterization, decision support, and many more.

What sets this opportunity apart from many data science career opportunities is the sheer scale of analysis. ORNL is developing massive, advanced workflows that process and analyze global geographic data on platforms with astonishing computational power such as the new Summit supercomputer. You will also have an opportunity to develop solutions on commodity cloud computing platforms. These offer you a unique opportunity to advance your HPC skills and scale your own solutions under the guidance renown scientists and engineers who are seeking to push the limit of computational power at Oak Ridge.

Working at ORNL

ORNL has an innovative and fast paced culture that rewards open source software development, has a flexible work schedule, and very competitive pay with industry. On any given day, after listening to a talk from a Nobel Laureate, you can eat two full-service cafés’, go to spin class, or visit the full-service primary care clinic, all without leaving our campus.

Living in East Tennessee

It’s easy to overlook everything East Tennessee has to offer if you haven’t had the opportunity to spend time here. From spending your weekends downtown at Knoxville’s farmers market, the Rhythm n’ Blooms Music Festival, or the Dogwood Arts Festival, to some of the best hiking, kayaking, and camping in the U.S., not only in Great Smoky Mountains National Park but all over the greater area, East Tennessee has something to offer everyone.

Job Activities

Contribute to the conceptualization and design of new algorithms that solve pressing data science challenges. Provide coding support to implement new algorithms as proof of concept or prototype to test effectiveness and scalability of the propose solution. Support AI/ML model parameterization and design Promote your own career visibility by contributing to team publications in leading journals, and conferences.

Basic Requirements: M.S. or higher in applied mathematics, statistics, data science, computer science or equivalent field with 2-3 years of experience. Substantial programming experience in R, Python, C, Java, Matlab, or similar. Comfortable working as part of a team For Ph.D. candidates, a proven track record of scholarship (e.g. publications, patents, copyrights, etc.)

Preferred Qualifications: Experience in AI tools such as Tensorflow, etc.

Special Requirement

This position requires the ability to obtain and maintain a clearance from the Department of Energy, which requires US Citizenship. As such, this position is a Workplace Substance Abuse program (WSAP) testing designed position which requires passing a pre-placement drug test and participation in an ongoing random drug testing program in which employees are subject to being randomly selected for testing.

This position will remain open for a minimum of 5 days after which it will close when a qualified candidate is identified and/or hired.

We accept Word (.doc, .docx), Adobe (unsecured .pdf), Rich Text Format (.rtf), and HTML (.htm, .html) up to 5MB in size. Resumes from third party vendors will not be accepted; these resumes will be deleted and the candidates submitted will not be considered for employment.
