Genomics Data Scientist (Cancer Immunotherapy) Background This is an exciting opportunity to work with next generation sequencing data from human tumor samples using modern data analysis pipelines at the interface of research and clinical trials in cancer immunotherapy. The focus of this position is genomics data analysis in support of research and biomarker development for on personalized neoantigen-based immunotherapies (e.g., cancer vaccines). Responsibilities Principled curation of sequencing data sets that address issues related to tumor heterogeneity Downstream analysis of NGS pipeline results from tumor/normal pairs including somatic mutations, copy number alterations, and neoantigen properties Algorithm development for analyzing neoantigen characteristics from cancer patient samples Benchmarking of cancer genomics analytical tools for quantifying tumor heterogeneity Position requirements Minimum of Masters degree in Bioinformatics, Genomics, or related fields, PhD preferred Experience with next generation sequencing data analysis and pipelines Familiarity with Linux and HPC environments Strong experience with R/R-studio and Python (pandas) for data analysis, visualization, and statistics Familiarity with modern tools for collaborative development work: JIRA, Confluence, GitHub/Bitbucket (version control) DBMS experience a plus At least 2 years hands-on experience in bioinformatics/computational biology not including coursework or internships Good data science intuition, and ability to understand and organize complex data Experis is an Equal Opportunity Employer (EOE/AA)
