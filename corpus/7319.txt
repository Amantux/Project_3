6,000 people dedicated to discovery - 6 research campuses across the globe. As a Data Scientist (Investigator II / III) you will be a part of this great community working to enable the next breakthrough in innovative medicines for patients in need. You will be at the forefront of life sciences, tackling some incredible challenges: curing diseases and improving patients’ lives.

As a member of the Scientific Data Analysis team, you will apply, adapt, and develop computational methods for a broad range of data, including, but not limited to, diverse genomic data types. Together with wet-lab scientists and other computational colleagues, you will help drive all stages of drug discovery towards novel innovative medicines, from mechanistic understanding of disease biology to therapeutic target identification, assay development, safety, and patient stratification. In your role, you will work closely with drug discovery teams from many different disease areas as part of a large community of hundreds of data scientists in NIBR and Novartis.

You will frame key questions, identify and define appropriate data sets, contribute to experimental design, and perform data analysis, to ultimately address key scientific needs for projects. You will collaborate closely with bench scientists, bio- and cheminformaticians, statisticians, computer scientists, and software engineers to integrate and make sense of high-dimensional pre-clinical and clinical data. This will require you to deploy cutting-edge data science techniques on a wide variety of different data types in order to enable drug discovery teams to succeed. As a successful candidate, you must demonstrate the ability to work collaboratively, to communicate well, and to deliver actionable results.
