The Challenge:

Are you excited at the prospect of unlocking the secrets held by a data set? Are you fascinated by the possibilities presented by the IoT, machine learning, and artificial intelligence advances? In an increasingly connected world, massive amounts of structured and unstructured data open up new opportunities. As a data scientist, you can turn these complex data sets into useful information to solve global challenges. Across private and public sectors — from fraud detection, to cancer research, to national intelligence — you know the answers are in the data.

We have an opportunity for you to use your analytical skills to improve a wide variety of capabilities for our clients across numerous market spaces. You’ll work closely with your customer to understand their questions and needs, then dig into their data-rich environment to find the pieces of their information puzzle. You’ll develop algorithms, write scripts, build predictive analytics, use automation, apply machine learning, have opportunities to publish, and use the right combination of tools and frameworks to turn that set of disparate data points into objective answers to help every branch of the military make informed decisions. You’ll provide your customer with a deep understanding of their data, what it all means, and how they can use it. Come join a rapidly growing data science team with a diverse background.

Empower change with us.
