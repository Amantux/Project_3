We are looking for a talented and creative Data Scientist interested to work within the Strategic Partnerships team.

Your role within our Kingdom

You will be working with varied stakeholders in a fun, dynamic and fast-paced environment. You will help us to further understand, model and predict how partnerships and co-marketing campaigns bring and engage players to our games and be part of a community of 100+ business intelligence & analytics experts.

Specifically, you will:

Understand the business context behind our strategic partnerships and establish the right metrics to answer our most critical business questions

Proactively develop new analyses and data-driven tools to better understand our collaboration and initiatives with platforms

Provide insights and estimations to support business cases and an analytic perspective to help drive priorities within your team

Translate business needs to technical requirements and A/B tests, and work with development teams to ensure correct implementation, taking care to correctly track the right information to allow easy, precise analysis of the impact

Work closely with Business Manager and Partnerships Account Managers to leverage insights from platform across multiple platforms

Collaborate with other disciplines to find hidden insights about our business

Share your insights in a manner that compels leadership to take action

Skills to create thrills

While we certainly don’t expect you to have all of these skills from day one, we do expect you to learn and develop in each of the following five areas:

Business Insight: The ability to understand the problems and issues our games and business wants to solve, and then defining the right data, analysis or interpretation to lead to the right recommendations and decisions

Communication: Designing good ways of communicating, visualizing or reporting your analyses and their results so they are clear and unambiguous

SQL: The ability to write SQL queries to analyze our data with 300+ million players and work with relational database systems.

Coding: Proficiency in R and/or Python for analysis and visualizations, automating manual tasks, and building tools

Statistics: Understanding of appropriate statistical techniques

Bonus points

Other experience that might be helpful, but is not required, includes:

Previous experience in the games industry or similarly customer-facing mobile app business

Familiarity with massive data sets and tools to deal with them (BigQuery, GCP, Hadoop/Hive, Spark etc.)

Experience in descriptive analytics, segmentation, and related areas

Skills with standard reporting tools such as Looker, QlikView, Tableau etc.

Personal Attributes:

Smart - intellectual dexterity and curiosity

High integrity

Low ego

Self-driven

Pragmatic problem-solver - someone who looks for solutions rather than worrying about problems

A great saga needs all sorts of heroes

Making games is fun. Especially when you do it with people who share the same idea of what makes a good workplace, great. We design games for everyone, no matter where they are or who they are, and we employ all sorts of people from all kinds of backgrounds to bring them to life. Truth is, we simply can’t expect diversity in our players and originality in our games without first nurturing it in our people. A great saga needs all sorts of heroes. And that’s it.

We’re Seriously Playful

Officially, we’re a leading interactive entertainment company for the mobile world. Unofficially, we’re a serious business that’s not afraid to have fun. Every day at King, we mix intuition with logic, art with science and magic with mathematics to create the games the world loves to play. Together with our parent company Activision Blizzard, our mission is to bring moments of magic to everyday life. If you think this is something you can help us achieve, let’s talk.
