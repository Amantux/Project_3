As a Chassis Process Engineer, you will report to the Manufacturing Engineering Manager. The main focus will be to develop and implement world class assembly processes to build a world class fully electric semi-truck. This will include working in all stages of the vehicle development process; from clay models to fully functional vehicles. This is a high focus and demanding position that will require an individual that can work to represent the production operator as the vehicle is designed. Must have good visual knowledge of how things go together.

In this role, you will:
Direct interface with Product Designers and Engineers to develop future vehicle designs with Design for Manufacturing focus
Develop Assembly / Manufacturing processes based on manufacturing best practices
Perform all necessary PFMEA’s and required control plans based on known DFMEA and Process definitions
Ensure assembly processes support the production operator for ergonomics, efficiency, and quality
Develop system layouts (factory flow)
Develop all work instructions based on standard time data that supports production cycle times
Develop all tooling and equipment list and technical specifications for all operator hand tools, power tools, fixtures, and assembly aids
Design of Manufacturing Equipment and Fixtures working closely with external equipment suppliers on equipment design
Focus on lean systems and methods for manufacturing – value added operations, minimize waste, short production systems, small lot material strategies, focus on the operator & safety
Develop common manufacturing requirements documents and help create standard tool libraries
Develop timing schedules to support on time production launch
Lead launch activities for area of responsibility from program kick-off through ramp acceleration
Support/Create Simulation Builds and 3D simulations
Ensure all timing milestones are met and are being tracked in relation to the program master schedule
Develop proper error proofing (poke-a-yoke) systems with focus on design before process solutions
Flexible to support travel for product development reviews (minimum 20%)
You have:
Bachelor's degree in Engineering – Mechanical or Electrical
Minimum (5) five years’ experience
Must be self-motivated, with a desire to continuously improve, learn and provide creative solutions
Experience using CAD. Proficiency in CATIA V5/V6 is a plus
Working knowledge of automotive assembly process and constraints
Demonstrate an ability to manage complex projects with tight timing constraints, providing examples of such scenarios throughout one’s career
Effective problem solver with knowledge and experience utilizing structured problem-solving methodology and experience introducing new products
Project launch experience from initial concept to final production
Exceptional organizational ability with good follow up skills and attention to details is a must
