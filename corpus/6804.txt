Read what people are saying about working here. 

Overview:

Foundation Medicine is dedicated to helping bring personalized cancer medicine into routine clinical practice. Harnessing advanced technology, Foundation Medicine is developing clinical laboratory tests that will broadly capture the most relevant tumor genomic and other molecular information in a single test, and connect it with relevant scientific and medical knowledge to help oncologists determine the right treatment for each patient.

We are seeking a talented and highly motivated Data Scientist/Analyst to support the development and deployment of cutting-edge, personalized clinical oncology assays. This highly-skilled individual will contribute scientific and analytical expertise to an interdisciplinary team focused on deploying high-impact, complex clinical assays at large production scale.

Your Impact:

You will join a team responsible for the genomics platform that powers every test at Foundation Medicine. The scientists and engineers in the group collaborate with other teams to enrich the analytical capabilities of existing products as medical knowledge advances, as well as to design and build lab protocols and computational analyses for new products. You will contribute to many of the projects we undertake, and those efforts will have direct impacts on patient care.

Responsibilities:

Work within an interdisciplinary team of molecular biologists, automation engineers, bioinformaticians, and software engineers focused on developing diagnostic products using massively parallel sequencing of tumor genomic DNA and RNA

Process, analyze, and interpret high volumes of data for the development and validation of methods, instruments and systems from a wide range of sources including molecular biology metrics, LIMS, sequencing and genomic data.

Develop data analysis strategies and pipelines for managing and executing large study analyses in one-off and repeated use scenarios

Monitor and evaluate analytical aspects of new and emerging technologies

Present scientific and technical data to colleagues in a clear and cohesive manner

Work independently and prepare timetables, deliverables, and project schedules

Qualifications:

PhD or MS in Bioengineering, Chemistry, Biochemistry or related fields with 2+ years of industry experience. Equivalent academic or professional experience will be considered.

Strong scientific understanding of molecular biology, genomics, statistics and quantitative analysis.

Experience with data analysis tools and programming and scripting languages is required (Python, Java, SAS JMP).

Experience with AWS or other cloud analysis tools is desirable.

Experience with team software development and configuration management (e.g. git) is desired.

Experience in cancer and NGS methods is highly desirable.

Excellent teamwork, time management and organizational skills.

Ability to work independently in a multidisciplinary, fast-paced, dynamic, and results-oriented environment.
