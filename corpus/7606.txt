At Lyft, community is who we are and it's what we do. It's what makes us different. To create the best ride for all, we start in our own community by creating an open, inclusive, and diverse organization where all team members are recognized for what they bring.

Data is at the heart of how Lyft makes business and product decisions. As a data science team, we work collaboratively with partners across product, engineering, operations and growth to develop business insights and make actionable recommendations.

We're looking for passionate data scientists to take on some of the most interesting and impactful problems in ridesharing. You'll work in a dynamic environment, where we embrace moving quickly to build the world's best transportation.

Data Scientists pursue a variety of problems ranging from understanding our passengers and drivers, to ensuring we have an efficient marketplace, to optimizing how we run our marketing and growth incentives. You'll dig into the data to uncover insights, design experiments and measure the impact, and help influence decision-making across the entire organization.

The Forecasting team builds short-term (real-time) and long-term forecasts of market signals to power business planning at multiple levels including engagement budget planning, supply positioning, pricing, support staffing, etc. We are looking for scientists to build experimentation and performance monitoring frameworks for forecast models, as well as perform deep analysis and build visualizations of spatiotemporal data and unstructured data such as events and weather.

You will report into a Science Manager.
