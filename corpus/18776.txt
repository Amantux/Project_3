Our mission at Progenity is simple: to help healthcare providers and patients prepare for life. We provide the most advanced molecular technology and the highest levels of service to guide patient care at critical life stages. We continually seek people with the motivation and skills to advance our mission.

As a key member of our Device Development team, the Principal Software Engineer is responsible for software activities across several projects for the development of electronics based medical devices. Development includes leading the software development process from pre-concept through architecture definition, development, verification, transfer, and product manufacturing. Primary activity is development for operation on a low power microprocessor including system level control and management of peripherals. In support of device realization, development and manufacturing aids are also created and deployed. Further RF linked satellite devices may be employed. The successful Principal Software Engineer has the strong engineering, scientific, and regulatory knowledge. This Principal Software Engineer shall work well individually in code development and tightly with other software, electronics, and mechanical engineers in rapid development of novel medical devices as well as lead other junior software personnel.
