Develop a lightweight and progressive multi-energy harvesting devices in a single architecture
Plan out the research and development of multi-energy harvesting device project carrying over from the successes of prior phase
Lead the project team in identification of and delivery to the milestones on time with superior results in further improving components of the device
Optimize the design, assembly, and manufacturing techniques for the multi-energy harvesting devices applicable for commercialization
Perform various experiments and tests that will add to solution design
Design and demonstrate high performance multi-energy harvesting device using Perovskite and dye-sensitized solar cells with other energy harvesting devices
Research material and device to enhance perovskite solar cell and dye-sensitized solar cell performance and stability
Provide expert scientific understanding and command advances in perovskite solar cell researches and applications, and translate them into commercial-development strategies
Understand the device degradation mechanisms and improve long-term operational stability
Assist in intellectual property protection and liaising with industry partners for technology transfer
