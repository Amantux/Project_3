Responsibilities

Serve as a senior data scientist in support of National Security Space, civil and commercial customers with an emphasis on applying data science techniques to cross-domain and cross-program analysis, forming and leading data science teams, articulating the value of data science to potential customers and mentoring junior personnel. This position is within the Acquisition Analysis and Information Department (AAID), which provides systems engineering and acquisition support for program planning and execution and is the corporate steward of the Acquisition Support and Systems Engineering Toolset (ASSET). AAID personnel collect, validate, manage, and leverage space and launch vehicle data with ASSET for data analytics and analyses, including anomaly and issue tracking, forecasting, and risk assessments. AAID subject matter experts (SMEs) provide front-end acquisition and systems engineering support to space, launch and ground programs and conduct studies & analyses that impact acquisition or programmatic decisions.

Key Functions

Apply data analytic approaches to improve program acquisition planning, assess potential system threats and implications, and develop automated methods for identifying and evaluating potential market and technology trends

Apply machine learning and natural language processing techniques to the correlation and analysis of data from different programmatic domains and programs, such as anomalies, cost, schedule, risk tailoring, acquisition process, programmatic outcome

Develop predictive analytics/leading indicators to determine programmatic health from large sets of programmatic data

Develop analytical techniques to determine out of family records in large datasets for follow-up by subject matter specialists

Develop machine learning techniques to categorize and relate large sets of unstructured data

Assist ASSET developers in architecting a roadmap for providing analytics as a service

Summarize and present analysis findings to senior staff and government customers
