Main responsibilities are to develop and improve discovery services that help researchers to find what matters to them (e.g. articles, researchers, funding opportunities). You will work on products throughout Elsevier from existing ones with high volumes of traffic to new and innovative ones. You will collaborate with cross functional agile team of data scientists, engineers and product owners to deliver end-to-end discovery products, and will assume data science ownership over certain components and continuously work to improve them.
