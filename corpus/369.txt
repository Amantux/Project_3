Read what people are saying about working here. 
Do you enjoy designing enterprise level research and analytic frameworks? How would you like to turn on your creative genius and problem-solving alongside business leadership? You will be using Big Data and advanced analytics to direct the engagement of our marketing business leaders as well as collaborating actively across functional partners to accomplish various project objectives. We are looking for someone who can execute research and analytics, including data source identification, processing, model/algorithm development. Ultimately your models will result in actionable recommendations which will drive business value creation.

You will get your hands dirty in the data and algorithm development, leveraging artificial intelligence and analytic tools (R, Python, Scala, Spark, Hadoop, KNIME, etc.) to unlock business building insights in our mountains of data. You will need to be adept at leveraging such technologies for solving ad hoc business problems, innovating on potential future solutions, and working with technology partners to translate your innovations into robust, scaled, analytic solutions applied to retail problems.

At P&G, Data Scientists are Business Leaders. The ideal candidate will be an effective communicator, self-motivated, and able to drive insights into actions that improve P&G’s business results. Your Business knowledge, interpersonal/communication skills are therefore a requirement to thrive in a multi- functional leadership team.

We need someone who is passionate about analytics. Your analytic skills are the foundation of this role. The ability to mine terabytes of data, derive actionable insights, and then translate those insights into business improving action is essential in our work. You will need to be the primary evangelist to the business for the power of predictive analysis and develop business cases to illustrate the potential for change in decision-making that occurs when you begin to anticipate what will happen, versus just reflecting on what has occurred.
