Summary/Objective

The Seafood and Food Security Data Scientist will join an interdisciplinary team focused on seafood production and trade within coupled human-natural systems. Seafood plays an important role in global food security, providing nearly 20% of global animal protein and supplying essential fatty acids and micronutrients. Seafood is also among the most highly-traded foods and the seafood sector is evolving with the rapid growth in aquaculture, geographical shifts in trade, and increasing commoditization and vertical integration. This research team brings together global trade data, local consumption data, and environmental impact data to understand the opportunities and risks of seafood globalization for sustainable production and food security.

The Seafood and Food Security Data Scientist will lead the open data and reproducible science components of this research program. Responsibilities would include data management for an NSF-funded project (Interactive Dynamics of Reef Fisheries and Human Health, CNH-L 1826668), assisting in publishing data and the underlying code for a global species trade network, helping coordinate with research teams to improve reproducible workflows, and exploring opportunities to leverage new fisheries and food security data sources.

This position is based at American University in Washington, DC and will be supervised by Dr. Jessica Gephart, but the Seafood and Food Security Data Scientist will interact with a network of interdisciplinary and international scholars. The individual will have opportunities to contribute to scholarly publications, learn new data skills, network with the DC data science, fisheries, food, and environment communities, and collaborate with transdisciplinary teams.
