PVAI provides a complete end-to-end case processing solution and transforms signal detection and evaluation through automated hypothesis generation and testing against a wide range of data sources. For a significant proportion of cases, PVAI enables “Touchless AE Processing' by utilizing a configurable workflow engine to automatically generate notifications and follow-ups without any human intervention. For those cases that need human review, our “Guided User Interface' helps the practitioner through the data fields that need verification, enabling more streamlined quality control. As practitioners make corrections to case data, PVAI continues to learn and improve in accuracy. By integrating AI across the information value chain, PVAI enables a self-learning, virtuous circle of improving data quality and insight. Our team ensures a low risk approach for introducing automation incrementally, and transitioning clients from manually-intensive processes to a highly simplified and automated PVAI operating model, all while maintaining strict compliance standards.
