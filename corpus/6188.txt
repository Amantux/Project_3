Rakuten Intelligence - San Mateo

Rakuten Intelligence is looking for a Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer to join our Information Extraction team.

The Information Extraction team at Slice is responsible for using machine learning to build the world's largest cross-merchant purchase graph from email.

As a data scientist / machine learning engineer, you will spend a mix of your time researching new solutions for information extraction as well as productionizing these solutions to make sure they work at scale. You will work with world-class data scientists who hold MS/PhD degrees from top global schools such as Stanford University, University of Washington, Carnegie Mellon University, and National Taiwan University, and veterans from companies such as Microsoft, AOL, Yahoo!, and Twitter.

Rakuten Intelligence was founded by proven entrepreneurs and, as a Rakuten group company, offers the best of both worlds: a start­up environment with the backing of an established global enterprise that is revolutionizing the internet services landscape.

This position will be located in San Mateo or New York.
