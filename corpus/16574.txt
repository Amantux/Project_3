Description:The coolest jobs on this planet or any other are with Lockheed Martin Space!

At the dawn of a new space age, Lockheed Martin is a pioneer, partner, innovator and builder. Our amazing people are on a mission to make a difference in the world and every single day we use our unique skills and experiences to create, design and build solutions to some of the worlds hardest engineering problems. Do you want to be part of a culture that inspires employees to think big, perform with excellence and build incredible products? We provide the resources, inspiration and focus - if you have the passion and courage to dream big, then we want to build a better tomorrow with you.

The Advanced Technology Center (ATC) is the research lab for Lockheed Martin Space. Through our own skills and those of our partnersincluding universities and research labs around the worldwe are able to put vision in motion. While we are a part of LM's space division, our technologies are far-reaching across domains. Napkin sketches of lasers that can shoot down UAVswe made it real. Changing molecules so metals behave differently? We invented that. ATCs story is written in the success of missions here on Earth and far, far into space. Our innovation extends beyond incremental change. We strive for first-of-a-kind capability with enduring impact. Whatever the application, our charter is to create game-changing technologies. At the ATC, we are inspiring change in our endless pursuit of what is next.

We are searching for a Senior Research Scientist to join our extraordinary team. In this role you will perform the research, development, analysis, and modeling and simulation of Electro-Optical (EO) Infrared (IR) phenomena. You will apply this research to understanding what are the fundamental physical observables associated with a wide variety of missions. You will participate on teams implementing this understanding to develop new and novel system architectures, and evaluate performance of existing architectures.

You are someone who has strong analytic and communication skills and work well in a dynamic, multi-disciplinary environment. You will both lead and support technical development projects. You will have proven experience clearly communicating complex ideas and explaining relevant technologies and concepts to an audience of both experts and non-experts. You will be responsible for writing reports and proposals, preparing and delivering presentations and new business pitches. We are also seeking a colleague with superior interpersonal skills, as you will interact with team members, customers, and executives.

To promote the sharing of ideas, Lockheed Martin fosters an inclusive work environment that encourages differences and big-picture thinking.
