QUALIFICATIONS MSc or PhD level in the field of Computer Science, Machine Learning, Applied Statistics, Mathematics Experience in statistical modelling and machine learning techniques Programming experience in at least two of the following languages: R, Python, Scala, SQL Experience in applying data science methods to business problems Experience in applying advanced analytical and statistical methods in the commercial world Good presentation and communication skills with the ability to explain complex analytical concepts to people from other fields WHO YOU'LL WORK WITH As a Senior Data Scientist at QuantumBlack in Boston you will work with other Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Machine Learning Engineers, Designers and Project Managers on interdisciplinary projects, using Maths, Stats and Machine Learning to derive structure and knowledge from raw data across various industry sectors. Who you are You are a highly collaborative individual who is capable of laying aside your own agenda, listening to and learning from colleagues, challenging thoughtfully and prioritizing impact. You search for ways to improve things and work collaboratively with colleagues. You believe in iterative change, experimenting with new approaches, learning and improving to move forward quickly. WHAT YOU'LL DO You will work in multi-disciplinary environments harnessing data to provide real-world impact for organisations globally. You will influence many of the recommendations our clients need to positively change their businesses and enhance performance. Role responsibilities Work on complex and extremely varied data sets from some of the world's largest organisations to solve real world problems Develop data science products and solutions for clients as well as for our data science team Write highly optimized code to advance our internal Data Science Toolbox Work in a multi-disciplinary environment with specialists in machine learning, engineering and design Add real-world impact to your academic expertise, as you are encouraged to write 'black' papers and present at meetings and conferences should you wish Attend conferences such as NIPS and ICML as one global team as well as Data Science retrospectives where you will have the opportunity to share and learn from your co-workers. Work with one of the largest and most advanced data science teams, support the Lead Data Scientists to develop data science products What you'll learn How successful projections on real world problems across a variety of industries are completed through referencing past deliveries of end to end machine learning pipelines Build products alongside the Core engineering team and evolve the engineering process to scale with data, handling complex problems and advanced client situations Be able to focus on modelling by working alongside the Data Engineering team which focuses on the wrangling, clean-up and transformation of data. Best practices in software development and productionize machine learning by working with our Machine Learning Engineering teams which optimize code for model development and scale it Work with our UX and Visual Design teams to interpret your complex models into stunning and user-focused visualizations Using new technologies and problem-solving skills in a multicultural and creative environment
