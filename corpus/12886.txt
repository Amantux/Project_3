We are pioneers at technology enabled services for biomarker data management and translational informatics. Managing and analyzing this complex biomarker data is a foundational aspect to delivering onthe promise of modern biomarker driven clinical research and Data Scientists play an important role toenable the delivery of precision medicine solutions on time for our clients. Our scientific team uses innovative technologies to rapidly interrogate biomarker data so you can stratify patients, identify novel drug targets, characterize MoA, and swiftly reach actionable information. You will provide programming and informatics services supporting translational research and clinical studies of healthcare products such as drugs and companion diagnostics. You will design and build new data set processes for modeling, data mining, and production purposes and figure out new ways to improve data and search quality. Does this describe you? You are a hybrid of a data hacker, analyst, communicator and trusted advisor. You thrive in a dynamic environment and a rapidly evolving field You are inquisitive and excited by a career of constant learning You are the Colombo of sorts and like digging in to understand the data, provide objective answers and real influence with our clients Taming unstructured information and analyzing it is exciting to you You have a natural curiosity about data and a real passion for finding new tools and platforms You have an open mind and are flexible making it easy for you to pick up on new programming trends in this ever-changing space You are in tune with our client's needs understanding what they want to achieve A little about what you'll be doing with us... You will build source code in R for use in biomarker data management, translational informatics, and biomarker driven clinical research You will develop and execute data processing, quality control (QC) and analysis pipelines for biomarker data such as flow cytometry, TCR sequencing, next-generation sequencing, gene expression, IHC and immunoassays You will develop documentation and data specifications You will perform source code validation and application testing You will contribute to the advancement of Precision's technology-based services in Biomarker Data Management You will Collaborate with team members and may handle or provide mentorship to junior level staff You will work on advanced complex problems and may take the lead in running a project tocompletion What You'll Need: Minimum Required: Master's or PhD in Computational Biology, Bioinformatics, Data Science, Biostatistics, Biology or related field Other Required: Expert knowledge of R programming Experience with genomic data and / or public databases (e.g. TCGA, dbGaP) Experience with relational databases such as MySQL Experience with source code management systems such as git Proven ability to work expertly under Unix/Linux environment Experience with processing biomarker data such as high-content flow cytometry, high-throughput or targeted gene expression assays (e.g. Nanostring, RNA-Seq), or other specialty lab data (e.g., immunoassays, IHC, SNP genotyping, qPCR) Ability to present work internally and externally Ability to work independently with little to no instruction on routine work Exercises discernment within generally defined practices selecting an approach for obtaining results Great teammate contributing to a positive, collaborative working environment Extended work hours may be required to meet business demands Read, write, speak fluently and comprehend the English language
