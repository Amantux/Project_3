Work with business stakeholders to understand the business requirements and the data available to solve the corresponding problems

Translate the business requirements to a problem that can be solved using statistical and/or machine learning techniques

Build datasets from different sources for data analysis and model development, which will include wrangling, cleaning, and pre-processing data

Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the patterns and potential business insights exhibited in the data

Create data visualization to summarize the insights discovered during the data analysis and communicate them to internal team members and business stakeholders

Develop statistical and machine learning models to solve business problems and derive actionable business insights

Help deploy models in various formats

Derive metrics for model performance monitoring and conduct continuous model performance monitoring (after deployment)

Present insights discovered from data analysis and statistical/machine learning modeling and make recommendation based on the results to internal team members and business stakeholders

Be proactive and take ownership of the projects and tasks assigned

Provide and support the implementation of business solutions

Collaborate with other data scientists and data engineers in our team

Lead small and participate in large project teams

Coach junior members and share knowledge with the broader team
