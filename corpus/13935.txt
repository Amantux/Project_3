Where will Amazon's growth come from in the next year? What about over the next five? Which product lines are poised to quintuple in size? Are we investing enough in our infrastructure, or too much? How do our customers react to changes in prices, product selection, or delivery times?

These are among the most important questions at Amazon today. The Topline Forecast team in the Supply Chain Optimization Technologies (SCOT) organization is dedicated to answering these questions using statistical methods. We develop cutting edge data pipelines, build accurate predictive models, and deploy automated software solutions to provide forecasting insights to business leaders at the most senior levels throughout the company. We are looking for a talented, driven, and analytical researcher to help us answer these (and many more) questions.


This Data Scientist role will design quantitative systems and forecasting models that generate multi-billion dollar predictions of the highest level of visibility and importance for Amazon's financial and operational planning. A successful candidate will be a problem solver who enjoys diving into data, is excited by difficult modeling challenges, and possesses strong communication skills to effectively interface between technical and business teams. As a Data Scientist on the Topline team, you will collaborate directly with economists and statisticians to produce modeling solutions, you will partner with software developers and data engineers to build end-to-end data pipelines and production code, and you will have exposure to senior leadership as we communicate results and provide scientific guidance to the business.
