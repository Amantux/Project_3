Job Description

We are seeking an inquisitive data scientist to join our team and work with our various datasets to find connections, knowledge, and potential issues in order to help our government clients make more informed decisions.

Your role on the Data Science team will be primarily focused on our large datasets, and you will design and implement scalable statistical systems based on your analysis. You will have the opportunity to expand and grow data-driven research across Govini, and lead new areas to apply advanced analytics to drive business results.

We need a creative, out-of-the box thinker who shares our passion and obsession with quality. As part of our team, you must be a data nerd with a strong understanding of the various fundamentals of data science and analysis, and know how to bring data to life.

This is a full-time team member position, working onsite in our Pittsburgh, PA office.

Scope of Responsibilities

Design experiments, test hypotheses, and build models for advanced data analysis and complex algorithms

Apply advanced statistical and predictive modeling techniques to build, maintain, and improve on multiple real-time decision systems

Make strategic recommendations on data collection, integration and retention requirements, incorporating business requirements and knowledge of data industry best practices

Model and frame business scenarios that are meaningful and which impact critical processes and decisions; transform, standardize, and integrate datasets for client use cases

Convert custom, complex and manual client data analysis tasks into repeatable, configurable processes for consistent and scalable use within the Govini SaaS platform

Optimize processes for maximum speed, performance and accuracy; craft clean, testable, and maintainable code

Partner with internal Govini business analysts and external client teams to seek out the best solutions regarding data-driven problem solving

Participate in end-to-end software development, on an agile team in a scrum process, collaborating closely with fellow software, machine learning, data and QA engineers

Qualifications

In order to do this job well, you must be a highly organized problem-solver and possess excellent oral and written communication skills. You are independent, driven and motivated to jump in and roll up your sleeves to get the job done. You lead by influence and motivation. You have a passion for great work and nothing less than your best will do. You share our intolerance of mediocrity. You’re uber-smart, challenged by figuring things out and producing simple solutions to complex problems. Knowing there are always multiple answers to a problem, you know how to engage in a constructive dialogue to find the best path forward. You’re scrappy. We like scrappy.

A burning desire to work in a challenging fast paced environment

Desired Skills

Expertise with building or using systems, such as Apache Beam or Spark, that can handle data engineering tasks

"Some of the biggest government contractors are looking to Silicon Valley for help winning new contracts. Big data analytics company Govini is promising companies better analytics geared toward identifying new opportunities to win work." - Washington Post

"Govini is all set to disrupt the market for professional services in government contracting in much the same way Google disrupted the market for advertising - by automating processes that were once handled in a one-off, non-repeatable basis." - FCW

"There are many professional services firms that just help manage processes around revenue capture. They, by hand, pull data and run metrics and shove stuff into Excel and in databases and come out with answers. In Govini, you can get the same answers in three clicks." - Federal Times
