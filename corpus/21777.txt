Strive Overview:

Founded in 2018, Strive Health is creating a new standard of kidney care to cut inpatient utilization, increase the adoption of home dialysis, and significantly improve patient outcomes and experience. Strive Health is working to reinvent how chronic kidney disease patients are engaged and treated before they reach the need for dialysis.

Leveraging comparative and predictive data and analytics to identify patients at risk, Strive Healths interventions significantly reduce the rate of emergent dialysis crash with pre-ESRD care and education. Strive seeks to get CKD and ESRD patients the care they need, via a comprehensive clinical model utilizing clinician extenders to engage and treat patients along their care journey.
