Job Description

As a Data Scientist at Square working on Capital, you will lead projects that derive value from our unique, rich, and rapidly growing data. Specifically, you will do analysis and build models which will help drive originations and reduce losses for our business loan products.

Specific problems you will solve include:

How can we detect fraud and avoid making loans to businesses who are unlikely to repay?

How should we size loans to balance risk and growth? What, if any, external data should we invest in to improve the performance of our credit models?

How do we optimize our marketing? For example, what is the optimal frequency and timing of emails?

Qualifications

Requirements:

2-4 years of relevant industry experience

Experience developing and deploying machine learning and statistical models

Strong quantitative intuition and data visualization skills for ad-hoc and exploratory analysis

The versatility to communicate clearly with both technical and non-technical audiences

A willingness to solve problems using whichever tool is most appropriate for the situation, balancing multiple business and technical constraints

Preferred:

A graduate degree in statistics, applied mathematics, computer science, physical sciences, or a similar technical field

Experience with lending and/or financial data

Technologies we use and teach:

Python (numpy, pandas, sklearn, xgboost, TensorFlow)

MySQL, Hive

Google Cloud Platform

Looker
