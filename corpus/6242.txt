In this exciting area of research, you will be applying machine learning techniques to problems in the life sciences with an emphasis on using computational approaches for detecting patterns in a variety of contexts including cancer, brain injury, infectious disease and microbial community datasets. Problems typically involve the construction of computational models for phenotype prediction from data that includes genomic data and other omics data. This role will develop and apply computational models on new experimental data, provide measures of uncertainty, and participate in interdisciplinary discussions aimed at the design of new experiments. You will report on results of research including publishing scholarly papers in scientific journals, give presentations at symposia, conferences, meetings, and seminars. You will also participate in the preparation of reports and proposals required by funding agencies to obtain and continue funding support. We are seeking outstanding people to join us in the Data Science and Learning Division and the Bioscience Division at all career levels. As a multidisciplinary national laboratory, Argonne offers an exciting campus atmosphere in which to collaborate on interdisciplinary projects developing solutions to complex scientific and engineering problems on the world’s largest parallel supercomputers.
