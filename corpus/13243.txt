The Data & Analytics Engineering organization of Liberty Mutual Global Retail Marketing is expanding its data modeling team. Data Modelers design transactional and analytical databases that translate complex business data into usable computer systems. Data Modelers work with data architects to design databases and data structures that meet organizational needs using conceptual, logical, and physical data models. Their models are designed to improve efficiency and business value and may focus on issues such as reducing data redundancy, improving data quality or improving data movement across systems.

An ideal Data Modeler is an analytical and creative thinker who is not intimidated by roadblocks and challenges. They understand how to successfully evaluate problems and develop appropriate solutions. Data Modelers perform well under pressure, possessing great focus while completing projects efficiently. They should be able to work well as part of a team, but also carry responsibility for their own work.
