Data Scientist

RevenueCat is managing subscriptions for hundreds of millions of users across thousands of apps and we're sitting on a treasure-trove of data. We are looking for a data scientist, working with our data engineering team, to turn this data into valuable analysis and products.

We're also pioneering the use of predictive bayesian models to democratize access to insights previously only available to teams with strong data backgrounds and resources.

About us

RevenueCat is an API that makes selling subscriptions in your mobile app easy. We launched as part of Y Combinator's summer 2018 batch and today are handling subscriptions for more than 3 million mobile subscribers, and are the subscription infrastructure for thousands of apps. We are a mission driven, remote-first company that is building for the long term.
