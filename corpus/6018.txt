What if your job description were simply "Accelerating Innovation through Trustworthy Experimentation." That's the essence of roles within our team. Are you a data scientist who has a strong appreciation for trustworthiness of results, insatiable curiosity, and ability to challenge yourself and drive a cultural change towards data driven decision making in multi-billion dollar businesses? Do you want to be involved in data-driven controlled experiments that regularly generate returns in the millions of dollars annually, sometimes over $100m? We are looking for experienced data scientists who know how to solve complex big data problems, work with statistics and algorithms, analyze big data and can run controlled experiments. You can be involved in experiments in a wide range of heavily used products from Bing to Office clients to Office services, Skype, Teams, Photos, MSN, Xbox, Windows, and more.

We are the Analysis & Experimentation Team (A&E) at Microsoft and part of the Cloud & AI (C&I). Daily, new data sources and signals come in and we need intelligent people who can dive into that data, make sense of it, and use it to solve large-scale problems all around C&I and Microsoft.

Did you ever think that two pixels could result in millions of dollars of added revenue? This was just one of the thousands of experiments that we ran. Want to be at the forefront of Big Data? Want to ship features at a startup-like pace? If so, join the Microsoft Analysis and Experimentation team. We are building a world-class experimentation platform (ExP) that accelerates innovations for key partners in Microsoft by testing new ideas quickly and reliably. Such as: What factors affect the quality of the Bing user experience? What causes users to make a first payment with XBox? The list of needs grows every day. The ability to experiment is credited as one of the key reasons that Bing quickly closed the gap on Google. We are now at the next phase of our mission: bring Bingâ€™s innovation process to the rest of Microsoft. Come and join us in the revolution!
