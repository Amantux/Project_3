What if you could use your technology skills to develop a product that impacts the way communities' hospitals, homes, sports stadiums, and schools across the world are built? Construction impacts the lives of nearly everyone in the world, and yet it's also one of the world's least digitized industries, not to mention one of the most dangerous. That's why we're looking for a talented Principal Kafka Engineer to join Procore's journey to revolutionize a historically underserved industry.

As a Principal Kafka Engineer, you'll join a highly skilled team of Site Reliability, Security, Data Administration, and Production Engineering disciplines dispersed across our Carpinteria, CA, and Austin, TX offices. You'll provide architectural guidance, mentorship, and hands-on support for all things related to Procore's cloud-based Kafka systems. You'll help lead strategic initiatives across the organization while also conducting a range of system management work including managing uptime, event integrity, disaster recovery, self-healing and alerting, and event reporting.

This position will report to the manager of our Data Administration squad and has the opportunity to be located in any of our US offices. Remote candidates will be considered based on experience. We're looking for someone to join us immediately.

What you'll do:
Work closely with Site Reliability, Security, and Development teams to ensure best practices are followed and architecture patterns are aligned with the requirements
Leverage subject matter and technical expertise to provide leadership, mentoring, and strategic influence across the organization
Provide hands-on support for all event-based systems including incident triage and root cause analysis
Support on-call participation, planning and change management, detailed runbooks, and documentation

Assist Application Developers with optimization and tuning

5+ years of of experience in Kafka or combined experience of 6+ years of Kafka and other message broker or event-driven technologies
4+ years of experience working within a Cloud infrastructure environment, on-premise or remote
