As a Sr Data Scientist, you'll apply mathematical concepts to data and business questions to generate insight and action. This role focuses on advancing the data, metrics, and analysis into statistically driven applications. The Sr Data Scientist spends about 50% of their time analyzing the data and applying mathematical concepts to generate statistics, models, and tests. As part of a team they consult on analysis and testing along with their users. They also document model selection criteria and how to interpret the model output for other stakeholders Use your skills, experience and talents to be a part of groundbreaking thinking and visionary goals. As a Sr Data Scientist, you'll take the lead as you…. set up data for proper tests and statistical analysis. You'll develop inferential and descriptive statistics to generate insights. You'll recommend and document the application of statistical models and build statistical models and integrate output into users platforms for data consumption. You would document variables that could improve analysis or insights; generate metrics and reports on the performance of their models. You would apply insights and testing in partnership with business users and identify hypothesis and document significance.
