Our vision at Xeeva is to harmonize business commerce and deliver results through intelligence. We are a software company that has built an artificial intelligence platform, which has important implications for machine-driven business intelligence, spend analysis, data cleansing, and e-commerce. We aim to instantly connect users to the information most meaningful to them to deliver business results. Realizing this vision involves work in areas such as recommendation systems, information retrieval systems, large graph analysis, machine learning, spam, etc. We are looking for a machine learning engineer data scientist to work on exciting algorithmic as well as deep infrastructure issues, all at a really big scale. Although you will work on cutting-edge problems, this position is not a research position. You will participate in the engineering lifecycle at Xeeva, including designing distributed systems, writing production code, conducting code reviews, and workingalongside our infrastructure and reliability teams. You will be equally comfortable doing incremental quality work and also building brand new systems to enable future quality improvements. What we want you to do: Apply data mining, machine learning, and/or graph analysis techniques for a variety of modeling and relevance problems involving users, their relationships, their transactional behavior, and data classification and enrichment Design and evaluate novel approaches for handling high-volume real-time data streams Code using primarily Java, Scala, and scripting languages such as Python or Ruby Conduct design and code reviews Interface with analytics, product management, and operations teams Work with large, unstructured and structured data sets (multi-gigabyte+, $100MM+ daily transaction volumes) Strong experience building big data pipelines/frameworks/foundational services at scale Design systems to handle internet-scale data sets and the unique problems they pose Research new algorithms and methods for data classification, enrichment, event identification, and data analysis Design experiments to answer targeted questions Draw conclusions from data and recommend action Develop new algorithms to improve accuracy, scalability, and process optimization Optimize and benchmark algorithms What we want to see: Demonstrated willingness to both teach others and learn new techniques Demonstrated leadership and self-direction Solid foundation in data structures, algorithms, distributed systems, and software design Previous experience with building predictive and prescriptive systems is a plus Extensive experience programming in at least one of the following: Java, Scala, C/C++ Knowledge of a scripting language, e.g. Ruby or Python S., M.S. or Ph.D. in computer science or equivalent work experience Knowledge of one or more of the following: machine learning, information retrieval, recommendation systems, social network analysis Familiarity operating Linux-based systems Experience with Hadoop, Pig, or other MapReduce-based architectures Who you are: Highly energetic and proactive Enjoy making sense of chaos and working with a diverse group of builders, entrepreneurs, creators, and all around great people Entrepreneurial at heart, thrive in an ever-evolving startup environment and your passion is evident in your work Passionate about the latest developments in technology Fast learner and open to constructive criticism Desire to dive in and learn in a fast-paced environment Collaborative team player with the ability to shift gears quickly, efficiently, and effectively Dependable and reliable with clear thinking and attention to detail Great sense of humor and outlook on lifeâ€¦we laugh a lot!
