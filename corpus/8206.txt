The Climate Corporation is looking for an applied mathematician with interests in numeric predictions of complex environmental systems. This position is within science R&D team that leverages numeric modeling, big data, cloud computing to address scientific challenges in precision agriculture. This team builds predictive models that are used directly by farmers, agronomists and consultants to optimize their management programs and economic returns.

The successful candidate will focus on creating predictive agronomic models for cereals and other crop systems. This team will work closely with collaborating teams focused on leveraging genetic, environmental and grower management data to create integrated models that can help growers better manage key aspects of these crops to improve yield outcome.

What You Will Do:

Explore, munge, and model large and diverse datasets

Implement and test algorithms and techniques relevant to achieving project objectives

Design and prototype models based on using diverse techniques that include, but are not limited to, machine learning, data mining, statistical modeling, and process modeling

Analyze and judge the quality of data and work with the data quality team to resolve issues

Work closely with a team of world-class scientists, engineers and mathematicians to deliver impactful scientific research

Select the most appropriate modeling techniques and data visualization for large datasets

Assist with high-level analysis, design, and code reviews

Basic Qualifications:

MS or PhD in Applied Mathematics, Statistics, or another highly quantitative discipline.

1+ years of experience after PhD or 3+ years of experience after MS with predictions involving complex systems (E.g. working with predictive models from a field such as climatology, ecology, biogeochemistry, etc.)

Experience linking measurements and models (e.g. via data assimilation, parameter optimization and/or performance testing)

Strong proficiency with scientific computing in an interpreted language (such as Python, R or Matlab)

Preferred Qualifications:

Experience with agriculture crop models as a developer or advanced user

Machine learning experience

Experience working with tooling for ETL operations on large datasets

Strong organizational skills

Ability and inclination to work in multi-disciplinary environments, and desire to see ideas realized in practice

Strong drive to learn new topics and skills and to develop innovative products for our customers

Excellent interpersonal and communication skills
