Job Description

As a Data Scientist at Optimizely, you’ll be in charge of Stats Engine, the core statistics methodology behind all our experiments. You will be a member of the Machine Learning/Statistics team and work on the cutting edge of statistics, helping answer questions like:

How can we safely employ multi-armed bandits in an A/B testing context?

Are approximate counting methods compatible with conventional hypothesis testing methods?

You’ll work with our product and engineering teams to build new statistics features for all of Optimizely’s products. You will get on customer calls to articulate how we maintain accuracy in our products as well as triage questions around statistical inference. You will educate internal and external stakeholders about core statistics concepts via webinars, speaking engagements, blog posts, and white papers. You will conduct original research and publish results in academic and industry conferences.
