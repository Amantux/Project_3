STRONG QUERYING EXPERIENCE IS A MUST. MUST HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH DATA ANALYTICS OR DATA WAREHOUSE!!!!! EXPERIENCE IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS A HUGE PLUS!!!

Â

Must Have:

This is a technical BSA so they need to have strong experience with data analytics and/or data warehouse

Must have experience querying data

Experience working with business stakeholders

Â

Project/ Business Problem:

This person will be working on their Guidewire upgrade project. This is their core insurance application platform. They are doing a huge Guidewire upgrade! It has been 2 years since the last upgrade and this is major. Because Mercury Insurance has customized their Guidewire so much to meet their business needs this upgrade will be difficult. Once it is upgraded they need to re-customize it! This is going to impact all reporting for policy, billing, and claims.
