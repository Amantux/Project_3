Accordingly, we perform vendor analysis and technical development based on industry best practices. When an off-the-shelf solution does not meet the needs of our partners, custom application development is necessary to bridge the gap between best-in-breed (specialized) and ERP solutions (general).



TTG prides itself on our ability to solve complex business problems with custom-tailored solutions that support the ever-changing business environment of our partners. We focus on business value first, aligning the strategy and direction of our partners with their specific technical needs, before providing a technology roadmap to implement the mutually established vision. By working closely with our partners and obtaining feedback along the way, we guarantee a positive experience that yields fruitful results.
