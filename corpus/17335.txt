Represent and align with the objectives of Development Sciences internally and externally in matters relevant to biomarkers and bioanalysis
Essential Requirements
The applicant should have minimum of a BSc (or equivalent) in a biological discipline
Proven track record of developing bespoke fit-for-purpose biomarker immunoassays from first principles for pre-clinical and clinical assessments
Effective ability to progress Biomarker assessments from Research through into Clinical Development; experience with CDx would be a bonus
Experience with linking Biomarker Strategy to Assay Specifications
Wide-ranging, direct, recent expertise with development of ligand binding assays/immunoassays from starting principles in the laboratory; the ideal candidate would be willing to contribute on an ongoing basis in the laboratory
Proven experience in immunoassays across platforms including ELISA, MSD, ELLA, Gyros, Singulex, Simoa/Quanterix, other; ability to compare case-specific pros/cons across platforms
Prior experience with initiating/defining requirements for case-specific tool reagent generation for assay development
Proven experience of biomarker assay development with diverse types of tool reagents
Proven experience of biomarker assay development across diverse immunoassay formats
Proven experience of factors for consideration for selection of appropriate endogenous controls and appropriate endogenous QCs tailored for the specific biomarker assay type
Firm understanding of biomarker assay validation for clinical assessments in the Clinical Study Report and demonstrable knowledge of the latest regulatory standards, industry best practices, attendance at relevant biomarker conferences
Clear grasp of context of use (linking assay requirements to the usage of the data generated)
Proven experience with identifying limitations/caveats of biomarker assays
Proven experience with setting LLOQ, MRD, validation tier and acceptance criteria
Experience working with Critical Reagents for clinical study support
A keen understanding of the impact of biological and assay variability for fit for purpose biomarker assay development and data interpretation and proven expertise in delivery
Demonstrated ability to multi-task effectively in a dynamic laboratory environment to project timelines with minimal supervision, communicate clearly to colleagues, able to discuss ideas, provide constructive challenge and useful feedback.
Adaptable to changing project and organizational priorities and consistently aligned with departmental needs

Preferred
Previous experience of working in a pharmaceutical drug discovery and assay development environment.
Experience working with a wide range of internal stakeholders including Therapeutic Area, Non-Clinical Safety, DMPK, Translational Medicine, Clinical Pharmacologists, Clinical operations and Quality Assurance colleagues.
Established track record of working with Contract Research Organizations in support of clinical immunoassay biomarker assessments
The analysis of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints
Experience of working with electronic lab notebooks
Knowledge of statistical tools for the analysis of assays
