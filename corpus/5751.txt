This Analyst performs the analyses while also technically supervising less experienced Analysts in those and other techniques as applicable. This role will also communicate effectively on multiple levels, using highly technical language with other Analysts and translating technical results clearly and effectively for Manager-Level and below teammates. Despite this being a technical role, this teammate’s business skills are high enough to develop professional relationships with managers outside of Analytics that instill trust in the Analytics methodologies. Performs primarily medium scale statistical analyses or medium scale modeling projects independently.

Responsibilities

Builds new predictive/descriptive models, evaluate current effectiveness of old models, design experiments/campaigns and analyze the resulting data, perform post-hoc (correlational) analysis when experimental designs (causational analyses) are not feasible and explains the limitations of the results, advises analytical data programmers on quality and infrastructure needs/challenges, etc.

Majority of time spent coding is on creation of new code

Write large blocks of code that will be run repetitively with moderate efficiency

Perform several of these types of analysis depending on capability to satisfy the need of the organization and project:

Sample Selection / Stratification

Experimental Design

Categorical Data Analysis

Linear Regression

Non-Parametric Analysis

Multivariate Analysis

Survey Design and Analysis

Survival Analysis

Time Series Analysis

Forecasting

Optimization

Simulation Models

Decision Trees

Heuristic Models

Algorithmic Models

Translating analytical results, presenting to Director-Level executives and below, and making recommendations for improvements in the areas of application

Creation of intermediate technical documentation

Identifies and with limited involvement from more experienced analysts resolves data issues (such as missing values and invalid data)

Creates basic transformations of data independently and intermediate transformations with limited involvement from more experienced analysts

2+ years of Python, R, or SAS programming experience in previous roles (Python experience preferred).

Expertise acquired through prior experience in applying statistical/mathematical techniques in 1 or more business units/focus areas (Operations, Supply Chain, Real-Estate, Pricing, Marketing, Manufacturing).

Able to analyze business data using 2 or more of the Statistical/Mathematical Specialties below:

Sample Selection / Stratification

Experimental Design

Categorical Data Analysis

Linear Regression

Non-Parametric Analysis

Multivariate Analysis

Survey Design and Analysis

Survival Analysis

Time Series Analysis

Forecasting

Optimization

Simulation Models

Decision Trees

Heuristic Models

Algorithmic Models

Intermediate Statistical ability, able to apply techniques as appropriate for medium data sets with <= 50 variables (columns)

Must be a proficient storyteller able to explain complicated statistical analyses, techniques, and results to non-statistical audiences of Director-level Executives and below.

Capable of working and communicating directly with Manager-level and below to scope the technical needs of medium scale, medium-value projects and ad-hock analyses.

Capable of assisting in the technically supervising junior level Statistical Analysts / Data Scientists
