Spira’s ORP™ is changing the way organizations gather, distribute and analyze information from their operations by digitally- linking the field and the office, creating a trusted source-record for revenue, cost, compliance, utilization and scheduling.

About Us:

Spira was founded in 2004 to address a complex challenge in the digital collection and management of operational billing and payroll data generated from remote locations.

The issue our clients faced was the need to manage the growing volume of manual data associated with labor, equipment, and materials being generated in disconnected, or ‘off-line’ environments. Spira developed its flagship software platform Spira Operational Intelligence and Spira Field Intelligence to address this unique requirement.

Born out of a need in the Oil and Gas services sector in Canada, Spira technology has found markets across North America in Well Servicing, Drilling, Production Testing, Hydraulic Fracturing, Construction, Fluid Hauling, Safety, Excavating, Daylighting, and Concrete. Anywhere there is a need to capture and transmit field data from a mobile device to the back office, Spira adds operational value across the private and public sector.
