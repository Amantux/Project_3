Netflix is revolutionizing entertainment and shaping the evolution of storytelling around the world. We deliver billions of hours of movies and shows per month to more than 180 million accounts globally, reaching new audiences every day.

The Studio Finance Data Science & Engineering team at Netflix is a talented group of analytics engineers, data engineers, and data scientists who help scale our rapidly expanding Studio efforts (more than $10B content investment last year). We conduct analyses and develop analytic tools, build predictive models and algorithms using machine learning, and develop new data pipelines, all with the goal of creating more joy for our members. Check out this blog post to learn more about the area and some of the problems we're working on, and for more about our broader research and analytics work, you can visit the Netflix Research website.

We're looking for a Senior Analytics Engineer who can help us deliver reporting, analysis, and insight to the Netflix Studio, with specific focus on production finance, budgeting, and human resources.
