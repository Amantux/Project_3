IntePros is seeking a Downstream Process Development scientist to join a premier client in Philadelphia, PA. We are seeking a highly-motivated and innovative process scientist with diverse experiences in downstream process development. The candidate must have biopharmaceutical industry experience to develop, optimize, and characterize downstream processes. A successful candidate will participate in multiple downstream process development areas for adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector in both early screening stages and late DS/DP stages.

Downstream Process Development Scientist Responsibilities:
• Develop the scalable downstream process of AAV virial vectors and provide the technical development report accordingly.
• Develop and optimize the cell harvest/ clarification and final UFDF process.
• Maintain GXP compliant good documentation with high level of detail, close-out experiments in a timely manner, write up development reports; work with downstream team members to maintain the PD downstream labs in a professional working environment.
• Working in the lab to perform experiments described above in the job primary duties.
• Design the experiments, discuss the experimental plan, analyze the data, and provide a summary and further suggestion.
• Identify, design and implement a new idea/ technology to the downstream processes.
• Prepare the process development reports and tech transfer documents
• Prepare the presentation in either team meeting or various project meeting.

Downstream Process Development Scientist Requirements
• MS degree in biochemistry, chemistry, chemical engineering, bioengineering, or related area with 3-4 year industry experience/ or Ph.D. degree in biochemistry, chemistry, chemical engineering, bioengineering, or related area with 1-2 year industry experience is required.
• Generally has 2-3 years of downstream process development experience of the biologics, such as viral vectors, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, and therapeutic recombinant proteins in the biopharma industry is required.
• Deep knowledge and understanding of downstream process of biologics is required.
• Hands-on experience of AKTA HPLC or equivalent system is required.
• Experiences of large scale GMP manufacturing and GXP compliant documentation is highly preferred.
• Strong scientific publication record and/or patent filing is plus.
• Working knowledge and skills for viral vector or vaccine purification is a plus.

Downstream Process Development Scientist Competencies
• Strong organizational skills and detailed documentation abilities is required.
• Work independently in hands-on laboratory setting, self-motivated to learn and develop new techniques
• Perform multiple tasks simultaneously, keep accurate records, follow instructions, and comply with company policies.
• Excellent writing and verbal communication skills is required
• Teamwork is a must.
• Must be comfortable in the fast-paced, multi-tasking biotech environment.
• On a regular basis, the PD Downstream Scientist needs to work closely with PD senior scientists and PD Downstream •Lead to design and execute various experiments, including complex and large-scale processes.
• Strong data organization skills, interpretation and troubleshooting are critical to be successful; New experiments should be designed based on available experimental data and scientific hypothesis; and executed the following experiments on time.
• Demonstrate independent problem-solving skills of technical issues; develop solutions to a variety of moderate to complex problems.
• Exercise judgement within defined procedures and practices to determine appropriate action
