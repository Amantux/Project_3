New Challenge: New Team, New Office! Protect Our Environment With Your Algorithms

Have you ever thought about pipelines and integrity? Why should pipelines need machine learning?

The answer is simple: Pipeline inspections generate a lot of sensor data (e.g. from ultrasonic sensors) which have to be analyzed using state of the art computer vision techniques. Think of it like doing healthcare just for pipelines.

Interested? Then learn more about industrial machine learning applications and data analysis for pipeline data in a start-up environment. Be part of a new team. Shape the team and your future. Enjoy working in a multi-cultural and multi-national team.

We love Python, C++, Tensorflow, Docker, Kubernetes and want to stay as close as possible to the state of the art tools, research in machine learning, data science and big data. Our ideal team member has a creative mind and natural curiosity when faced with challenging data science tasks. We cherish self-improvement and continuous learning and we offer the possibility to create new data-driven visions for the future using your own methods.

We are looking for a new team of:
Data Engineers for Industrial Image Data
Data Scientists for Industrial Image Processing
Software Developers / C++/PyThon
Linux Administrators / DevOps

You will be working in an extremely creative environment with a lot of freedom, focused on a joint target with great opportunities to grow internationally.

ROSEN is going to extend its Data Analytics Footprint in Columbus, Ohio and you can be part of this groundbreaking journey for our company.

Responsibilities:
