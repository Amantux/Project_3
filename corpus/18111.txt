Title:Software Configuration Engineer at NASA/JSCPosition Description:Opportunity to serve as a Group Administrator (GA) in the Mission Control Center (MCC) at NASA's Johnson Space Center (JSC). This GA position manages the software configuration on the workstations used by the flight controllers in the MCC by installing custom applications, updating data and configuration files, and writing/maintaining scripts that ensure that the applications are in the correct configuration and run as expected. This support allows flight controllers to monitor and control space vehicles such as the International Space Station (ISS), Boeing's Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100 Starliner spacecraft, and Lockheed Martin's Orion spacecraft.Responsibilities:This position is part of a GA team whose responsibilities are primarily to define and manage the software configuration of the MCC workstations prior to scheduled activities such as tests, simulations, and mission operations. Most of a GA's tasks are short-term, request-driven tasks (as opposed to long-term project tasks) and are driven by the needs of the flight controllers and software developers. Some of the GA's tasks are as follows:* Perform configuration management of the applications and data files used by the flight controllers.* Write and maintain the shell scripts (e.g, C shell, Bash shell) that set the configuration of individual applications and start those applications when initiated by the flight controllers.* Install custom applications in the appropriate directories and repositories to ensure the correct versions of applications are used for the appropriate activity (e.g, test, simulation, mission).* Work with flight controllers, software developers, mission integration personnel, and others to ensure that the proper configuration is defined and in place for operations.* Provide 24/7 on-call support to a flight control discipline (or disciplines) as the first point of contact for configuration issues.* Perform these tasks per a set of defined processes and standards.Work & Experience Requirements:* BS degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, Computer Information Systems plus a minimum of 10 years of related experience.* Experience with the Unix/Linux command line interface and shell scripting (e.g., C shell, bash shell, Bourne shell).* Excellent communication skills (both oral and written).* A "service-oriented personality", since this role is first and foremost a support role to the flight controllers.* Strong analytical and problem-solving skills.* Work experience in the MCC at Johnson Space Center is highly desired.* Experience with the Windows command line and shell scripting is a plus.* Experience with a source code version control tool such as RCS, Git, or Subversion is a plus.Scheduled Weekly Hours:40KBR is an equal opportunity employer.
