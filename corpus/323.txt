About the Organization & What Makes Us Unique:

Truckstop.com was founded in 1995 as a small family-owned business with a dedication to becoming the best-in-class transportation solution. As one of the largest online freight matching services in the trucking industry, we provide a one-stop connection between carriers, brokers, and the shipper. The company which has remained privately-held, has grown exponentially in the last 24 years into more than 7 locations across the U.S with a focus on innovation and forward-thinking digital vision.

At Truckstop.com talented individuals are empowered to do what they do they do best while having fun doing it. We call our employees partners because we unite to achieve remarkable things together.

Be "you" is the message that executive leaders foster, building first-in-class culture of exceptional people with a "One Team" mindset, driven from the top down.

Despite our vast business development and growth into more than 460 "partners", the commitment to our talent where service and respect run hand-in-hand with camaraderie, collaboration and fun culture, still remains our passion.
