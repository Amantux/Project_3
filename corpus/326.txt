About the Organization & What Makes Us Unique:

Truckstop.com was founded in 1995 as a small family-owned business with a dedication to becoming the best-in-class transportation solution. As one of the largest online freight matching services in the trucking industry, we provide a one-stop connection between carriers, brokers, and the shipper. The company which has remained privately-held, has grown exponentially in the last 24 years into more than 7 locations across the U.S with a focus on innovation and forward-thinking digital vision.

Despite our vast business development and growth into more than 460 "partners", the commitment to our talent where service and respect run hand-in-hand with camaraderie, collaboration and fun culture, still remains our passion.
