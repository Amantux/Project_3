We believe that a great writing experience is fast, outcome-focused, and alive with your ideas. Going from start to finish on a document in three minutes. Knowing who will respond to anything you've written before you even press send. Writing software that puts your ideas at the center, with language that is certain to land the way you want. Textio has already changed the way that thousands of companies write and now we are looking for a creative and curious data scientist to join us.

Our team is looking for a data scientist who is passionate about finding the story in a dataset. Your analyses on Textio's core datasets will shape the way Textio communicates with customers and will influence the future direction of our data products. This is a unique opportunity to flex and grow analysis skills in a collaborative role that partners with both technical and non-technical colleagues.

You will be joining a supportive and learning-focused data science team at a company that deeply understands the value of data. Textio is a phenomenal place to build, learn, experiment, and deliver impact as a data scientist. Does this sound like your kind of adventure? Come join us!

What you’ll be doing:

Pairing with Textio's data storytellers to find the narrative in a dataset and ensure clarity, accuracy, and richness in the stories that Textio shares with the world

Partnering with colleagues across our organization to translate business questions into analyses, and analyses into operational and product impact

Contributing to the development and maintenance of patterns that deepen, accelerate, and automate Textio's data analysis capabilities

Communicating analytical results and progress to colleagues across Textio

Becoming a technical expert in the hiring and other text-based data that fuels Textio's products

Using SQL and Python to get to the heart of questions, and learning new tools and skills as Textio evolves

We’d love to hear from you if:

You love building repeatable analyses that are precise, interpretable, and inventive

You can find the narrative in a data set, using your skills of data exploration, statistical inference, and visualization

Your approach to analysis is iterative, hypothesis-driven, and guided by a desire to discover and learn

You view data anomalies as invitations rather than nuisances, taking the time to understand the scope, value, limitations, and nuances of a data set before you draw conclusions from it

You create practical analytical solutions that are guided by business context, simplicity, and the contours of the relevant data

You enjoy collaborating with people in many roles and learning about a range of business and data domains

You have the technical skills to explore and analyze data independently, and the self-awareness to ask for input when appropriate

You demonstrate a track record of trying and learning new things

You have a point of view and are low ego

We're not looking for ninjas or rockstars. We want to work with awesome and innovative people who can help us use data to make Textio the best that it can be.

Textio embraces diversity and equal opportunity in a serious way. We are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. The more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

Working at Textio is outstanding. Learn more about our philosophy, benefits, and team at https://textio.com/careers/. Share your story with us!
