Job Family Summary Data Science incorporates techniques across many disciplines – including mathematics/statistics, computer programming, data engineering and ETL, software development, and high performance computing – with traditional business expertise with the goal of extracting meaning from data to optimize future business decisions. Individuals in this field should be an expert/fluent in several of these disciplines and sufficiently proficient in others to effectively design, build, and deliver end to end predictive analytics products to optimize future decisions. Individual demonstrates sufficient analytic agility to quickly develop new skills across these disciplines as those disciplines evolve. Data, Discovery & Decision is responsible for aligning with and contributing to corporate objectives by identifying and developing growth and profitability opportunities that will enable Allstate to generate profitable market share growth. The Data Scientist family is accountable for using data to make decisions, which includes building predictive models and developing new machine learning techniques that enable Allstate to make better decisions to achieve its goals. The Data Scientist Family requires Analytic Agility, the ability to quickly learn new modeling/machine learning techniques, programming languages, and see how these ideas can integrate to optimize the business. Job Description This role is responsible for leading a cross-functional project team building Allstate's platform for deep learning on photographic images of homes. The Data Scientist Manager/Data Product Lead must coordinate the efforts of Data Scientists and Engineers to build an end-to-end system including the pipeline for image and data ingestion, suite of deep learning models, and integration of outputs into downstream systems. The right individual will be fluid with machine learning modeling choices and techniques as well as engineering considerations for building production-ready services. This role is focused on technical build of data modeling products, but the right individual must also be able to fluidly converse with the business users of the predictions delivered by those products.
