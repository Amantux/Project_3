Job Description


Are you looking for a patient-focused, innovation-driven company that will inspire you and empower you to shine? Join us as a Sr Scientist - Digital & Image Analysis/Computational Pathology at our recently dedicated San Diego Research Site.

At Takeda, we are transforming the pharmaceutical industry through our R&D-driven market leadership and being a values-led company. To do this, we empower our people to realize their potential through life-changing work. Certified as a Global Top Employer, we offer stimulating careers, encourage innovation, and strive for excellence in everything we do. We foster an inclusive, collaborative workplace, in which our global teams are united by an unwavering commitment to deliver Better Health and a Brighter Future to people around the world.

Here, you will be a vital contributor to our inspiring, bold mission. As a Sr Scientist - Digital & Image Analysis/Computational Pathology, you will be empowered to serve on project teams for discovery to development programs.

OBJECTIVES/PURPOSE

Lead the development of image acquisition and digital analysis capabilities that complement high-content cell phenotyping technologies being developed in our rapidly expanding translational laboratory.

Embed within project teams to provide digital imaging, image analysis, and statistical support that drives the development of key GI drug assets throughout the life cycle of the project.

Serve as an image analysis expert for translational strategy planning that efficiently drives projects from preclinical assessment up to early clinical implementation.

We are a rapidly evolving translational research laboratory within the GI Drug Discovery Unit of Takeda with the goal of implementing innovative cell phenotyping capabilities that drive development of the next generation drugs for the treatment of GI disease. This position will provide an opportunity to lead the development and expansion of the digital analysis cornerstone that will serve as an essential component of an integrated effort between pathologists, translational researchers, and preclinical scientists. Insights gained from these informatics tools will be used to inform preclinical go-no go decision making, identify drug mechanisms of action, and identify predictive biomarkers that serve to rationally direct early clinical trial design.

ACCOUNTABILITIES

Advancing Imaging Analysis Capabilities
Report to and work with the Translational Scientist to align the development of image analysis tools with high-content cell phenotype testing being conducted in our Internal and external laboratories
Implement imaging analysis approaches and machine learning to improve appropriate segmentation in tissue and deduce changes in immune context using immune and non-immune marker co-localization with digital spatial analyses
Develop image co-registration capabilities that allow the merging of sequentially-stained tissue section images for analysis at both the tissue and cell-to-cell level
Develop/enhance imaging algorithms to quantify cell membrane and nuclear biomarkers
Provide target quantification using approaches such as percent positive and signal intensity scoring
Utilize statistical analyses tools to support conclusions drawn from image analysis
Develop best practices for image management as it relates to the storage of high-content images and the linking of associated metadata files
Cross-Program Support
Work directly with the DDU scientists to deliver immunophenotyping analysis in support of translational research and biomarker identification across our preclinical GI programs
Work with our units computational biology group to combine cross-platform omics data with spatial immune profiling in an effort to deliver a new level of translational profiling capabilities
Serve as an image analysis expert for translational strategy planning that efficiently drives preclinical assessment throughout the development cycle
Prepare and present findings from image analysis to the project teams
