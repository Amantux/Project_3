The role of the Sr. Data Scientist is to work on business impact-driven AI and ML projects with an emphasis on predictive solutions. This role will require extensive experience using a variety of data mining/data analysis tools and methods, building and implementing machine learning models, using/creating algorithms, creating/running simulations, and deploying and monitoring solutions in production settings. The Senior Data Scientist must have a proven ability to drive business results with their data-based insights and must be comfortable working with a wide range of stakeholders and functional teams. The right candidate will have a passion for discovering solutions hidden in large data sets and working with stakeholders to improve business outcomes.

Job Responsibilities:

Develop proof-of-concept (POC) data science solutions for business use-cases as specified by key stakeholders

Specify data requirements to solve a given use case

Analyze and visualize data to draw insights and validate hypotheses

Identify the best approach / algorithms to solve a given use case

Prototype algorithms using Python and/or other languages with appropriate libraries and frameworks

Present solutions / findings to senior management

Continuous research to stay updated with state-of-the-art artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science tools & solutions

Work with engineering teams to productize solutions
