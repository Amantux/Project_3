Description
The Business Analyst is involved in projects that have more than one functional role. He or she reports to the Functional Lead. The Business Analyst is an important front-line Avanade representative because of his or her deep involvement with various stakeholders in the client's organization from end users to managers.
The Business Analyst acts as a primary link between the client and the technical project team, facilitating effective communication between them and ensuring that business needs are aligned with technical solutions.
Involved throughout the project lifecycle, the Business Analyst works with the client to understand their business strategy and objectives, current business processes and challenges, and how information flows and changes through the business. The Business Analyst uses this information, coupled with deep understanding of the Medicaid platform, to help translate the business needs into a set of detailed requirements and proposed to-be processes.
The Functional Lead then transforms the requirements into a functional design and works with the Solution Architect and development team through the build, test, and implementation stages. In these stages, the Business Analyst is also responsible for helping the client conduct acceptance testing and prepare for the new technology through effective communication, training, and user adoption planning.
