What's the opportunity?

--------------------------------------

At Intercom, the Analytics & Data Science team partners with every function in the organization in order to help teams make data-informed decisions and take data-informed actions. We're highly quantitative individuals who love to turn data into insights and communicate our findings fearlessly, and we're looking for people with a similar mindset who are constantly curious, driven to understand our business better, and committed to creating value.

In this role, you will partner with go-to-market teams across Intercom (including Sales, Marketing, Finance, and R&D) to measure new initiatives and make data-driven recommendations around go-to-market strategy. In addition to being strong analytically, we're looking for someone who has experience proactively surfacing recommendations and insights, who's comfortable prioritizing work across multiple stakeholders, and who can work across the analytics and data stack in order to solve problems. If this sounds like you, we would love to hear from you!

To give you a sense of some specific projects you might work on, here are a few of our recent workstreams: monitoring changes in the health of the new business funnel, understanding how users respond to new pricing, analyzing the customer signup experience, measuring the performance of paid advertising campaigns, prioritizing the leads our sales team should reach out to, and many more.
