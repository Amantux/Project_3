We're here with the humble aspiration to accelerate the speed of human progress with our radically simple, all-flash enterprise storage technology.

Our all-flash storage solutions offer radically simple technology to help companies unlock their future possibilities, today.

Our founders created the company with a passion to build storage technology customers love and deliver it with simplicity and service that fundamentally changes the enterprise storage experience. Founded in 2009, our record revenue growth has landed us among a very select group of companies. Today, customers and industries across the world are experiencing the benefits of going Pure - from Barclays to Linkedin.com and ConocoPhillips, Pure adopters cover a broad spectrum from global consumer brands, to healthcare, education and finance.
