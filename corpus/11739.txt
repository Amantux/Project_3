Job Description 
We are looking for a strong  Data Scientist or  Machine Learning Engineer (MLE) - a proven 'doer' to develop, implement and extend data-intensive ML software for real-time auctioning, ad inventory estimation, and audience segmentations. 
You will design and implement core components of our algorithms, as well as model and monetize the terabytes of structured data that PubMatic generates daily. 
Working with our Data Science and Ad Serving teams, you will apply ML to help get things done. 
 Responsibilities : 
Development and implementation of data-intensive ML algorithms and software for real-time auctioning, ad inventory estimation, audience segmentations, and related AdTech applications. 
Working with data scientists, product managers, and software engineers to develop and support the software for new ML products. 
Ensuring excellence in delivery to internal and external customers  Qualifications 
MS / PhD in STEM field 
3+ years of hands-on industry work experience designing and building large-scale ML algorithms and ETL that are well-designed, cleanly coded, well-documented, operationally stable, and timely delivered
