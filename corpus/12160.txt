Primary Purpose: The Data Scientist will be responsible for acquiring the necessary data, running various modelling and other analytical techniques to draw insights, preparing the results in a way that is conducive to business decision making. In some cases, these analyses may result in the use of these analytical models on a day to day basis by the business. Duties and Responsibilities: Data science and analytics Running advanced statistical analyses identifying trends, and exploring opportunities with the aim of generating actionable insights Developing predictive models that address business needs and measuring performance of these models to ensure business improvements. Using data science platforms such as SparkML, H2O, FlinkML, and TensorFlow Prototype to production Designing, developing and implementing product prototypes that are piloted and converted to products the use of which is institutionalized within the business Working closely with the business to collect feedback, incorporating in the product, as well as maintaining and improving its functionality over time Developing and institutionalizing best practices for scalable data processing and machine learning Assessing and mitigating possible risks and supporting and performing product and application upgrades to address them Collaboration and interaction with other teams Working closely with data management colleagues to guide them on structuring relevant data to facilitate data exploration and fast prototyping Working closely with business insight managers to ensure business relevance of analytics processes and products Big Data infrastructure strategy and planning Helping data engineers maintain data models, to ensure data is structured properly and identify any improvements Providing input on the roadmap for data infrastructure, working with internal / external stakeholders to drive this roadmap, and ensuring execution with clear objectives and timelines Working with data engineers on incorporating data from external sources which would complement internal data Data flow operation and maintenance Supporting internal colleagues and consultants with the extract, transform and load process to ensure data is delivered properly Conducting day-to-day administrative maintenance and support required, including monitoring, alerting and quality assurance Specialized Knowledge/Skills: Expert in working with large data sets, simulation / optimization and distributed computing tools (Map/Reduce, Hadoop, Hive, Spark, Gurobi, Arena, etc.) Excellent understanding of different statistical models and the trade-offs between them Strong experience in working with distributed systems and technologies (e.g., Apache Mesos, Apache YARN, Marathon, Hadoop/HDFS) Outstanding track record of building, leading and maintaining large-scale data science platforms (e.g. cloud infrastructure preferably in AWS/GCE), models and more importantly products, while ensuring engagement and innovation around the data Proficient in at least one scripted language (e.g. Python, R, Matlab), and especially its scientific / statistical packages Good degree of hands-on experience in data integration and data mining Strong data visualization ability (at minimum, working with basic visualization tools such as Tableau and Qlik), and proficiency in communicating insights Change agent – Strong communication skills and experience with change management to help change mindsets and behaviors across the organization Analytical, commercial mindset - Highly analytical with a structured problem-solving approach. Cultural fit – Proactive problem solver with immediate professional and intellectual credibility and an impactful style Education/Training: MS/PhD in computer science, statistics, or operations research or related technical discipline (eg. math) Certifications in statistics, data mining and machine learning a plus 2+ years' experience in a statistical and/or data science role, with deep knowledge of machine learning, statistics and optimization Physical Demands/Environmental Conditions: Travel at approximately 5%
