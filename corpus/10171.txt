US

We are not married to specific tools, technologies or shiny objects. We ask questions until we arrive at the best answer for the patient. We believe glycoproteomics is a new language of biology that we are translating for the benefit of patients, researchers, science, and medicine. We have diverse backgrounds and experiences, are happy challenging the status quo, and always remain solution oriented. If this sounds like a good fit, read on.
