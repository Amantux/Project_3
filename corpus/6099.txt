POSITION SUMMARY:

The data scientist role is crucial to enable the Curacao’s transformation to adopt best practices on Fintech. Providing a frictionless customer experience requires automation on the back end. This automation needs to be supported by machine learning and artificial intelligence(AI) implementations across all the customer’s journey. The data scientist will be responsible for developing the machine learning models and AI.

ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS:

Stay up to date in new machine learning/AI algorithms and applications

Big data manipulation

Develop machine learning predictive and decision models

Track the performance and adjust existing and newly developed models.

Mentor the analytics team in machine learning and its related methods.

Develop decision models to increase the automated credit decisions from 70% to 99%.

Develop fraud detection models for different touchpoints. (i.e. online transactions, credit applications, change of address)

Develop models that can be leverage across the customer’s lifecycle.

Implement and manage models in Decision Engine.

Minimum Requirements

BASIC QUALIFICATIONS

Advanced degree (M.S. or Ph.D.) in Mathematics, Statistics, Econometrics, Operations Research, Computer Science, Engineering, Physics or other quantitative fields.

Proficient in statistical analysis environments such as R, SAS and Python

Expertise of model building, predictive modeling and machine learning/AI.

Superior organizational skills, be self-driven with attention to detail and follow-through on tasks

Fast learner, self-learner, proactive and used to a hands-off management style

Proficient in following topics: linear regression, logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, clustering, naive Bayes, time series, support vector machine, neural network, principal component analysis, Markov chain Monte Carlo, Non-parametric method, survival analysis and natural language processing.

Expertise in Decision, Data and business rules engines.
