Primary Responsibility
The Senior Data Scientist will turn raw data into insights using expertise in exploratory and predictive analytics. This hands-on analytical role will partner with scientists, bioinformaticians, IT specialists and clinicians to develop data models, perform complex data-driven analysis, create custom and template reports, and build repeatable data pipelines. Key responsibilities include:
Hands-on interpret data and analyse results from multiple sources across research, manufacturing and clinical to inform T-cell product development and improve patient experience
Design data analytics methods and other strategies that optimize data efficiency and quality across the enterprise
Use highly specialized software tools and techniques to interpret data sets, paying particular attention to trends and patterns that could be valuable for descriptive, diagnostic and predictive analytics efforts
Create statistical and machine learning algorithms and/or data pipelines, and assess their effectiveness through solid validation workflows
Communicate data analysis results with sophisticated visualisation methods, traditional paper-write up and oral presentation
The Senior Data Scientist will be highly visible and expected to significantly contribute to broader data analytic outcomes. This role blends a strong business sense with IT expertise, bioinformatics, immunology, and mathematics to provide insight scientific and clinical challenges with advancing T-cell therapy. IT infrastructure and enterprise architecture activities will be managed and supported by others.
