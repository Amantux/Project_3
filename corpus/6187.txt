Red Lambda is seeking an exceptional data scientist as a member of the team responsible for continued development and innovative enhancement of the Company’s cybersecurity solution software.

This is a unique opportunity to join a new, multidisciplinary team of creative and passionate individuals that are changing the face of cybersecurity and security-related anomaly detection. Focused on the company’s agenda of detecting cyber threats in real-time – before damage can be done – you will work on high-impact projects utilizing big data analytics and machine learning to improve anomaly and threat detection in corporate IT infrastructure.

We’re a lean and highly creative team combining science and engineering to identify and inject high-value insights into cybersecurity anomaly detection utilizing complex, big data analysis techniques, machine learning, and behavioral analytics.

Responsibilities

Advocate, evangelize and build data-fuelled products that help our customers improve their ability to detect cybersecurity-related anomalies

Provide insight into leading analytic practices, design and lead iterative learning and development cycles, and ultimately produce new and creative cybersecurity analytic solutions that will become part of our core deliverables.

Work with cross-functional team members to identify and prioritize actionable, high-impact insights across a variety of core business areas.

Lead applied analytics initiatives that are leveraged across the breadth of our cybersecurity solutions.

Research, design, implement and validate cutting-edge algorithms to analyze diverse sources of data to achieve targeted outcomes.

Provide expertise on mathematical concepts for the broader applied analytics team and inspire the adoption of advanced analytics and data science within Red Lambda solutions.

Qualifications

PhD. or Master’s Degree in operations research, applied statistics, data mining, machine learning, physics or a related quantitative discipline

Deep understanding of statistical and predictive modeling concepts, machine-learning approaches, clustering and classification techniques, and recommendation and optimization algorithms

10+ years of experience delivering world-class data science outcomes, and a demonstrated ability to solve complex analytical problems using quantitative approaches

You’re passionate about asking and answering questions in large datasets, and you are able to communicate that passion to product managers and engineers. You have a keen desire to solve business problems, and live to find patterns and insights within structured and unstructured data. You propose analytics strategies and solutions that challenge and expand the thinking of everyone around you.

You are expert in analyzing large, complex, multi-dimensional datasets with a variety of tools. You are accomplished in the use of statistical analysis environments such as R, MATLAB, SPSS or SAS.

Experience with BI tools such as Tableau and Microstrategy. You’re as comfortable with relational databases as you are with Hadoop-based data mining frameworks. You are familiar with SQL, Python, Java and C/C++.

You desire a fast paced, test-driven, collaborative and iterative engineering environment.

You excel at making complex concepts simple and easy to understand by those around you and you are driven to show the world the power of applied analytics.

Ideally candidate would be located in Orlando, FL or willing to relocate.

Employee Compensation & Benefits

Red Lambda offers a very attractive compensation package which includes a competitive base salary, a full company-sponsored health care package and stock options. Additionally, all employees have access to a fully equipped gym.
