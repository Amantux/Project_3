As a data scientist in the Chief

Data Office (CDO) group, you’ll use your talent for breaking down

business challenges into data-driven problems that guide improvements in

customer satisfaction and generate millions in savings and potentially

revenue. Your solutions could influence everything from fleet

optimization and energy efficiency to content analytics and marketing – often

before the problem even happens. Add the ongoing skill development and

collaboration with some of the brightest minds in the field, and you will be

poised to make an impact. You will utilize the latest machine learning

and statistical algorithms to create predictive and prescriptive models by

detecting and exploiting patterns in massive datasets. You will also create data

visualizations and give presentations that will help key stakeholders in their

decision making process.

with our innovative technology solutions? We are looking for candidates who love learning new things, like

playing with data and want to get things done. We need people that feel

comfortable across the entire spectrum of data science, from meeting with

business partners and brainstorming on the whiteboard, all the way to

implementing and testing their models.
