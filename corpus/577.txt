The Challenge:

Are you excited at the prospect of unlocking the secrets held by a data set? Are you fascinated by the possibilities presented by the IoT, machine learning, and artificial intelligence advances? In an increasingly connected world, massive amounts of structured and unstructured data open up new opportunities. As a data scientist, you can turn these complex data sets into useful information to solve global challenges. Across private and public sectors — from fraud detection, to cancer research, to national intelligence — you know the answers are in the data.

We have an opportunity for you to use your analytical skills to improve the way our clients in defense, intelligence, and commercial industry apply artificial intelligence to critical mission areas. You’ll work closely with Booz Allen to understand our clients' questions and needs, and then dig into their data-rich environment to find the pieces of their information puzzle. You’ll develop algorithms, train neural networks, apply machine learning, and use the right combination of tools and frameworks to turn that set of disparate data points into objective answers to help senior leaders make informed decisions. You’ll provide our customers with a deep understanding of their data, what it all means, and how they can use it. Join us as we use data science for good in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.

Empower change with us.

Build Your Career:

At Booz Allen, we know the power of analytics and we’re dedicated to helping you grow as a data analysis professional. When you join Booz Allen, you can expect:

access to online and onsite training in data analysis and presentation methodologies, and tools like Hortonworks, Docker, Tableau, and Splunk

a chance to change the world with the Data Science Bowl—the world’s premier data science for social good competition

participation in partnerships with data science leaders, like our partnership with NVIDIA to deliver Deep Learning Institute (DLI) training to the federal government

You’ll have access to a wealth of training resources through our Analytics University, an online learning portal specifically geared towards data science and analytics skills, where you can access more than 5000 functional and technical courses, certifications, and books. Build your technical skills through hands-on training on the latest tools and state-of-the-art tech from our in-house experts. Pursuing certifications? Take advantage of our tuition assistance, on-site bootcamps, certification training, academic programs, vendor relationships, and a network of professionals who can give you helpful tips. We’ll help you develop the career you want, as you chart your own course for success.

You Have:

Experience with developing algorithms that leverage theory from a quantitative discipline to generate novel insights

Experience with building Machine Learning algorithms

Experience with programming in a language, including C++, Java, Python, R, or similar

Experience with integrating principles from 2 of the following areas in algorithms: linear algebra, number theory, complex analysis, optimization theory, signals processing, image processing, graph theory, group theory, probability theory, Bayesian statistics, or frequentist statistics

Ability to obtain a security clearance

BA or BS degree

Nice If You Have:

Experience with building algorithms on 2 of the following architectures: CPU, GPU, FPGA, or distributed Hadoop-like architectures

Experience with using Deep Learning frameworks, including Keras, Tensorflow, pyTorch, or similar

Experience with ISR or Cyber domains and data types

Experience with version control systems, including git, subversion, or similar

Experience with querying and processing data from SQL and NoSQL databases

MA or MS degree in a quantitative discipline, including Mathematics, Physics, or EE

Clearance:

Applicants selected will be subject to a security investigation and may need to meet eligibility requirements for access to classified information.

We’re an EOE that empowers our people—no matter their race, color, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, veteran status, or other protected characteristic—to fearlessly drive change.
