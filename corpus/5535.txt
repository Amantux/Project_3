There’s a lot of work around Osmo for someone with a love of statistics.

For one there’s anonymous player statistics that need to be distilled into understanding of what works and doesn’t work for the player population. Someone in this role would have to support product developers, ideally providing views of key metrics and helping them understand effects of updates on them.

There’s also a business-level need for processing our data. In this role you’d be constantly striving for a better understanding how play patterns and purchase patterns relate. You’d also be seeking to better qualify and quantify the life cycle of the consumer, as well as help identify and prioritize opportunities discovered from studying usage data.

Our stack currently involves BigQuery, Java, and Periscope… but you may find that you need other tools to build more innovative views, and this will largely be at your discretion.

As with all roles at Tangible Play, the ideal candidate would be largely self-managing, prioritizing their task list and providing estimates and visibility for stakeholders in other roles.
