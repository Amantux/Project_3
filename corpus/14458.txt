A position for a post-doc will be available in the laboratory of Dr. Jlenia Guarnerio at the Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The appointments will be for 1-3 years with the possibility for extension based on productivity and research.

Cedars-Sinai Medical Center ranks among the nation’s top ten non-university hospitals receiving federal funding for research and currently has more than 1,500 active research projects. Cedars-Sinai Cancer Center supports basic and clinical research in many cancer-related areas and researchers are seeking more effective ways to diagnose, treat and prevent many forms of cancer.
Cedars-Sinai is situated in the heart of Los Angeles at the border with Beverly Hills, in a very dynamic area of the city, and in the proximity of the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA). Ongoing education and training are offered throughout the institute, with the possibility to promotions to positions of instructor. Competitive salary and excellent benefits are also provided.

Guarnerio Lab : Cedars-Sinai Cancer

Our lab's goal is to understand the interactions between highly aggressive cancers and the non-malignant cells of the microenvironment in order to identify molecular vulnerabilities and develop novel therapies, especially in sarcoma and leukemia. We work in a highly collaborative environment incorporating functional genomics, proteomics and biochemistry approaches that include single-cell and spatial single-cell transcriptomics, mass-cytometry, Hyperion imaging, and state of art mass spectrometry technologies.
We are seeking highly motivated and qualified individuals with a PhD in biochemistry, molecular or cell biology, cancer biology or cancer immunology to take over independent research projects on the leukemia microenvironment.
Our previous work showed that Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are essential to maintain both normal hematopoietic stem cells and leukemic cells within the endosteal bone marrow niche (Guarnerio et. al., Stem Cell Reports, 2014; Guarnerio et. al., Nat Comm 2018). Future work will elucidate the cancer-sustaining interactions between leukemic cells and MSCs, and will employ spatial single-cell transcriptomic approaches as well as functional genomic screenings to define the molecules at the cross-talk between MSCs and leukemic cells.

Responsibilities:
• Organize and manage experiments in a dynamic environment
• Design, execute, and critically interpret experiments and present data in a cogent and compelling manner
• Present data at lab meetings, institutional seminars and international conferences
• Under the direction of the PIs, assist in drafting grant proposals, study protocols, and manuscripts

Credentials and Qualifications:
PhD or MD/PhD degree

Experience:
The ideal candidate should have:
• Technical proficiency in cell culture and hands on mouse work (s.c, i.v, i.p. injections).
• Extensive experience in flow cytometry.
Individuals with training in cancer biology and functional genomics techniques (i.e. screening with CRISPR/Cas9 libraries) are particularly encouraged to apply.
Training in statistics or programming is a big plus but not required.
• Publication track record (at least one peer reviewed paper as first author).
• Excellent oral and written communication skills.
• Ability to perform and prioritize multiple simultaneous tasks.
• Candidate should be industrious, highly collaborative, and enthused by a vibrant team environment.
