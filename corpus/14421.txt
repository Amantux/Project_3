Job Description: Principle Scientist, Immunology

Myst Therapeutics, Inc. is a newly formed biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of novel cancer immunotherapy products designed to harness the power of a patient’s own immune system to destroy cancer cells. We are pursuing the development of an adoptive cell therapy utilizing neoantigen-enriched T cells from tumors and peripheral blood. Myst plans to combine methods of identifying neoantigen reactive T cells from tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) published from the National Cancers Institute’s (NCI) Surgery Branch with state-of-the-art techniques in cell sorting, T cell rejuvenation, and industry leading expertise in the development and manufacturing of cell therapies. We believe this combination will enable Myst to rapidly advance and commercialize these highly promising and innovative enriched neoantigen reactive therapies addressing a wide range of advanced solid tumors.
