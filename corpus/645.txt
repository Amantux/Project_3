Read what people are saying about working here. 

We are Drybar, a blow dry bar, and we set out to shake up the beauty industry in our own, specialty way. We believe in doing one thing and being the best at it. For us, that’s blowouts. In fact, our tagline says it best: No cuts. No color. Just blowouts. What started with one shop in Brentwood, CA has grown to over 100 locations across 25 markets, with more to come.

Drybar is seeking a data scientist to join our Marketing team.

Responsibilities

Data Munging

Collect data from a wide variety of corporate databases and Excel files.

Utilize your toolset in regular expressions to extract information from un-structured text documents and the web.

Use your inner whiz-kid to feature engineer the data to boost model accuracy.

Predictive Modeling

Utilizing your algorithmic/programming toolkit, build predictive models to drive acquisition, engagement and retention and improve growth and profitability, and other such key performance indicators for our business.

More specifically, apply algorithms equal or similar to the following: elastic net regularization for regression, random forests, generalized boosted models, generalized additive models, support vector machines, neural networks, and time-series forecasting. Ability to communicate implications of the level of confidence in each of the models.

Implement formal modeling processes from end to end including data gathering, data profiling, numerical model building, calibration, cross-validation, putting product into production, etc.

After building the models, pilot “scorecards” to track model performance and calculated improvement to business.

Explain complex modeling approaches in layman’s terms and discuss modeling results and business case impacts with non-technical business users.

Test/Learn Analytics

Develop a portfolio of test and learn programs, lead the test design and measurements/goals and manage the day-to-day execution of the corresponding analyses.

Establish robust A/B and fractional factorial testing methodologies including sample size requirements for readability and go/no-go criteria for scaling.

Lean-out testing processes to cut end-to-end cycles times and accelerate weekly test cadence.

Manage testing calendar and minimize test collisions given test objectives and audiences.

Establish tracking of value identified, validated in-market, and scaled across marketing channels and eCommerce.

Create, maintain, and deliver dashboards and reports for KPI results from test measurements and communicate results to key stakeholders.

Monitor and interpret results and suggest next steps for new test and rollout of programs to key stakeholders.

Conduct ad hoc analysis for internal partners as requested, including in-depth funnel and conversion analysis

Support the maintenance and development of web analytics platforms.

Customer Glidepath and Audience Management

Estimate causal impact of marketing activities on financial outcomes in the short and long term.

Integrate Marketing ROI models with multi-touch attribution models (e.g., consistent media taxonomy, rationalize ROI estimates).

Prepare quarterly media optimization scenarios to inform media plans, financial forecasting, and target areas for efficiency gains.

Provide insights to marketing and channel leads on cost to acquire, value of digital engagement, and cross-channel impact of media.

Ensure high quality inputs into media mix models including accurate media spend by market, pricing/promotion position, competitor spend, and channel support.

Establish and maintain expert knowledge of the latest methodological innovations in marketing mix modeling.

Qualifications

Bachelor’s degree in mathematics, business, statistics, economics, computer science or equivalent combination of education and experience.

2-5 years of directly related experience and strong proficiency of predictive modeling techniques, test/learn, customer segmentation and mixed media modeling.
