Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the health care industry. In 5 to 10 years, hospitals, pharmacies, and physicians' offices will operate very differently than they do today. At Omnicell, we are inspired to be part of this change. As the leading innovator in pharmacy- and medication-management systems, providing services and solutions to more than 4000 hospitals worldwide, we have geared up for the health care revolution. The main focus of the Data Science Innovation Team (DSIT) is to make Omnicell's vision of an autonomous pharmacy a reality. As a member of the DSIT, you will have autonomy to collaborate with every team in the organization, and you will be able to directly connect to decision makers without dealing with bureaucracy. You will be involved in multiple projects on various timelines. You will be expected to develop strong working relationships with various departments, to represent the DSIT, to provide direction for members of all levels and departments, and to speak about new and upcoming developments in your field.
