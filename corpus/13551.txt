Apply state-of-the art quantitative clinical pharmacology and pharmacometric methods within assigned programs to yield high value pharmacometric support for critical decisions to advance development candidates
Represent pharmacometrics as the subject matter expert on multidisciplinary project teams
Develop and execute M&S plans to support candidate drug development
Perform and report population PK, PK/PD and disease progression analyses
Proactively incorporate and develop approaches and methodologies based on review of relevant scientific literature
Author M&S sections for regulatory interactions and responses
Participate in maintaining scientific awareness and presence in quantitative pharmacology and pharmacometric science, preparation of abstracts and manuscripts for publication
Strengthen our pharmacometric capabilities on a continuous basis by evaluating and incorporating new M&S tools and initiating trainings as appropriate
Actively contribute to a high-growth, transformational company that is Bold, Relentless, Curious, and Collaborative
Here’s What You’ll Bring to the Table:
PhD or PharmD with a focus in pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, pharmaceutics or other related field and at least 2 years drug development experience

About Moderna:

Moderna is advancing messenger RNA (mRNA) science to create a new class of transformative medicines for patients. mRNA medicines are designed to direct the body’s cells to produce intracellular, membrane or secreted proteins that can have a therapeutic or preventive benefit and have the potential to address a broad spectrum of diseases. The Company’s platform builds on continuous advances in basic and applied mRNA science, delivery technology and manufacturing, providing Moderna the capability to pursue in parallel a robust pipeline of new development candidates. Moderna is developing therapeutics and vaccines for infectious diseases, immuno-oncology, rare diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, independently and with strategic collaborators.

Headquartered in Cambridge, Mass., Moderna currently has strategic alliances for development programs with AstraZeneca, Plc. and Merck, Inc., as well as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Defense, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a division of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). Moderna has been ranked in the top ten of Science’s list of top biopharma industry employers for the past five years. To learn more, visit www.modernatx.com.
