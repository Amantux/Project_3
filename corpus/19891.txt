CUNY Fellowship in the Behavioral Sciences


The City University of New York (CUNY) - Office of Institutional Research and Assessment (OIRA) announces a one-year fellowship in the behavioral sciences. Behavioral science is the study of how people make decisions and act within a complex world where details and context matter. It draws from decades of research in the social sciences to create a more realistic framework for understanding the way people form intentions and take actions.

Behavioral science has been used across a variety of fields to realign policies, programs, and products with how we really behave, improving outcomes for millions of people worldwide. OIRA is testing the use of lessons from the behavioral sciences at CUNY through a project called the Student Persistence Initiative (SPI), which is funded by the Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity.

CUNY is the nation's leading urban public university serving more than 275,000 students in 25 colleges and institutions in New York City. CUNY-OIRA conducts research and provides data to improve student success and acts as an incubator for new interventions, providing rigorous evidence to identify the most effective, and taking the best to scale at CUNY. SPI is one of these projects.

Under the supervision of the Director for Institutional Research, the fellow will provide quantitative analytic support and data for the implementation and scaling of a set of behavioral interventions over the course of academic year 2020-21. The fellow will work in collaboration with partner CUNY schools and the SPI Project Manager to develop and implement projects that address barriers to student engagement, retention, and success. Planned projects include scaling multi-year interventions through Blackboard, emails, and text messages.

Responsibilities may include but are not limited to:
Conduct student data extraction and analysis (including, but not limited to, academic records, enrollment data, Blackboard analytics, and student experience survey results)
Analyze the effectiveness of SPI interventions and their impact on retention and persistence (including, but not limited to, graduation rates and transfer rates)
