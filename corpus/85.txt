Description: Ascendum Solutions is looking for a Data Scientist (or a ninja), who can do data science and data engineering and data analytics (need to be an expert on at least one topic and familiar with all). Flexibility is important to this role as our work is dynamic.   Tools such as Python (including Pandas, NumPy and Scikit-learn) and Tensorflow will be heavily leveraged.    Deep learning will be applied to images and videos (Convolutional Neural Networks) and potentially to longitudinal data (Recurrent Neural Networks). | |
