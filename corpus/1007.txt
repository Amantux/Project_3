Enjoy working on a range of projects simultaneously in a fast-paced team environment.
You will be part of a talented client-focused team that helps our clients understand and quantify uncertainty in an increasingly complex and data driven energy landscape.

The responsibilities for this role include:
Leading or contributing to quantitative analysis and model development as part of energy infrastructure investment, expert witness testimony, market and regulatory proceedings, benefits case assessments, whitepaper development, stakeholder engagement, business model development, and business integration.
Identifying and executing creative approaches to quantitatively evaluating energy infrastructure benefits and costs as well as risks and risk mitigation;
Independently initiating and completing analysis surrounding optimization in competitive markets, stochastic simulations, and the interplay between zero- or low-marginal cost resources and traditional energy generators.
Leading quantitative research tasks related to energy, ancillary services, and capacity markets.
Developing new models and tools that support a long-term view of energy market evolution, especially in light of clean energy policies.
Successfully navigating and meeting deadlines that span a number of different projects.
