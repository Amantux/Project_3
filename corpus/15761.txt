Vertex Pharmaceuticals is seeking a highly motivated and experienced Cryo Electron Microscopy (CryoEM) Data Scientist to join our San Diego Protein Sciences team. The individual will develop and implement state-of-the-art algorithms and methods to optimize and improve current CryoEM structural biology workflows to deliver high resolution structures of proteins within and outside its cellular context. This includes the development, automation and implementation of efficient approaches for CryoEM data collection, image processing, 3D-structure determination, and analysis. The ideal candidate will be responsible to relate his/her work to the companys drug discovery strategies, accelerate mechanism of action studies and facilitate structure-based design of new therapeutics. The candidate must be team-oriented with a desire to collaborate in a creative and dynamic work environment.

Specific responsibilities include:
Hands-on computational work to improve and automate current CryoEM workflows from data acquisition to 3D structure determination
Develop and integrate cutting-edge software, new imaging, and processing algorithms to support high resolution 3D structure determination of proteins within and outside its cellular context
Resolve protein dynamics and/or multiple molecular states from structural data
Present regular research updates to protein sciences, cross-functional, and project teams
Work effectively in a fast-paced matrix environment and serve as a representative on cross site or external collaborations
Minimum Qualifications:
Ph.D. in Life Sciences and 3+ years of relevant CryoEM experience in integral membrane protein structural biology evidenced by scientific publications in high impact journals
Track record of hands-on development and integration of cutting-edge CryoEM imaging and data processing algorithms and/or software to deliver 3D protein structures. Experience with Cryo-electron tomography is a plus
Demonstrated ability to independently identify and solve tough problems across several projects
Excellent collaboration, communication (oral and written) and multitasking skills and able to present work formally to Scientific Research Committees
Ability to propose and/or support external collaborations leading to innovative solutions
Ability to navigate and be successful in a fast-paced, highly matrixed work environment
Preferred Qualifications:
Experience in developing both small molecule and genetic based therapeutics
A desire to be part of a highly innovative company aimed at transforming the lives of people with serious diseases, their families and society
