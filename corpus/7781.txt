What we're looking for

Civis Analytics is looking for Applied Data Scientists to join its DC-based political team.

This team will build the next generation of data science for Democratic and progressive organizations, and Applied Data Scientists will play the principal leadership role on the team.

Civis' objective this year and next is simple: we want every political client organization to be data-driven and digital first. Here's how you'd help:

First, the Civis platform is the technology of record for hundreds of in-house data scientists and analysts across the progressive movement. We seek to extend the feature set and capabilities to help these users quickly and self-reliantly accomplish their missions through data.

Second, Civis is building new digital technologies to help campaigns make the transition to digital outreach. It's 2019 after all. We're building the measurement, execution, and attribution tools to help these campaigns measure, target, and spend their dollars effectively and transparently through digital tools.

About the Role

The political Applied Data Science (ADS) Team works closely with candidates, independent political organizations, and advocacy groups to provide strategic insights about elections up and down the ballot.
