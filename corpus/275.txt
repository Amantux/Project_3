customers. You would support the cutting-edge programs in national
security-related systems based in space, in the air and on the ground.

This Data Analytics role will work in a collaborative
team-focused environment with technical understanding and practical
application in prototyping, designing, and
integrating niche tools which will be used in an analytical environment.
This position will help progress, establish, incorporate, and advance current
and promising concepts to inform tactical decision making timelines. Your role
is to provide needed knowledge and proficiency to develop algorithms, support
modeling and simulation efforts and provide data analytic skills to conduct
analyses to support physics-based modeling for Indications and Warning
platforms and sensor systems in the defensive space domain. This position
is available immediately and is in direct support to the community’s space
situational awareness mission.

Responsibilities include but are not limited to:

- Conduct analysis of mission data
applicable to defensive space domain to promote awareness and understanding
about threat behaviors and vulnerabilities
Formulate and interpret problems in mathematical or computational terms
Design, develop, use, and evaluate mathematical models, methods, and
algorithm application to explore concepts and solve problems for the customer
Develop, maintain, and enhance complex and diverse software algorithms (e.g.
processing-intensive analytics, novel process development, manipulation of
large data sets)
Advance and progress space-based models for integration into simulation
scenarios

- Research analysis products and
tools for possible integration to enhance Modeling & Simulation framework

- Create
new tools and applications using a variety of software languages, frameworks,
