As a Data Scientist, you will define and build models, mine big and small data to better understand complex data structures. Act as the catalyst of process reengineering through advanced analytics. You will work in a dynamic organization to turn data into actionable intelligence. The variety and complexity of challenges you will solve is second to none, but most important is the real world impact your work will have on the lives of millions of people. About the Position: Support the Vendor Performance Manager, to understand, measure and analyse the performance of Client's supply base, providing key data mining techniques, deep insights to senior leadership to drive transformational change, whilst alleviating risks and ensuring that maximum value and savings are realised through Client's global supply chain. • Statistical & Probabilistic Analyses • Data Engineering • Research and develop statistical models for data analysis • Keep up-to-date with latest technology trends • Communicate results and ideas to key decision makers • Implement new statistical or other mathematical methodologies as needed for specific models or analysis • Effective Visualization and Presentation Key Accountabilities: • Identify, extract, and integrate data sets ranging in size from spreadsheets to big data • Client the best methods of assimilating data from several different sources and formats for use in analyses • Prepare and clean data for use in advanced analysis • Deploying sustainable cleansed data solutions • Employ sophisticated analytics programs, machine learning, and statistical methods for predictive and prescriptive modeling, forecasting, and simulations • Combining complex data sets, including but not limited to, third party spend, supply chain risk, contract performance • Periodically audit data to identify areas that require additional focus • Support the establishment of data policies and procedures • Continually work toward establishing single reporting repository to reduce data duplication and quality issues • Establish self-service analytic capabilities for business functions • Identify new data needs, providing expertise to business functions and IS to incorporate into existing reporting repository • Understand data flow and synchronization between systems and create and improve master data management • Work collaboratively with Data Stewards and Data Owners to ensure alignment on data quality and on data governance • Be intellectually curious and enjoy learning   TCM is an EEO/Vets/Disabled Employer. | As a Data Scientist, you will define and build models, mine big and small data to better understand complex data structures.
