Job Summary

S/He will define business problems and identify the data needed to solve problems.

Outcomes

6 months out:

Establish uniformity of context with the claims data collected for our clients from various external resources (self-insured health system programs, commercial carriers, and TPA’s).

Refine the frequency, severity and cause of loss analysis. Build out the analysis on the medical provider risk profiles using data captured in our Medical Risk underwriting platform.

Work with external parties to educate on type of data needed and how best to populate it.

Consult with clients on establishing clinical indicators that can positively affect quality, cost, safety and satisfaction measures, or identify risk factors within the patient population that need to be understood in order to provide proactive care that heads off avoidable bad outcomes that lead to malpractice liability cost or threats to revenue/reimbursement.

Build out proof of concept that if we help providers (physician, hospital and long term care) deliver and document performance metrics, we will be able to reduce malpractice liability cost simultaneously with optimizing revenue under pay for performance reimbursement models.
