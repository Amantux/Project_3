Job Description
Data Scientist â€“ Washington DC

JCDS is seeking a Data Scientist to compile data analyses in support of a variety of health care innovation projects for the Department of Veterans Affairs.

The Data Scientist will support individual projects in their data and analytics needs, use existing data to develop business cases, and support portfolio-wide analyses of effectiveness and impact. Awareness of the Veterans Health Administration data storage platforms, such as the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW), or the appropriate SQL knowledge to run data queries is a plus.
A strong candidate must demonstrate the ability to clean, manipulate, and analyze data using modern programming languages (Python, SAS, MATLAB, C++, R, Java, SQL, PL/SQL) or business intelligence platforms; this ability will support the team as they run Machine Learning Challenges. The ideal candidate would understand research methodologies commonly utilized in the health care innovation space and be able to design a research methodology with limited client input. Finally, the person would also help the program office assess effectiveness of their projects, which requires some unique problem solving.
