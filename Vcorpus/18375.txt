Talend has been recognized as a leader in its field by leading analyst firms and industry publications including Forbes, InfoWorld and SD Times.

Talend’s Philadelphia office opened in 2018 with the acquisition of Stitch, a cloud data integration service, which is now part of Talend Cloud.

What You’ll Do

We work on a variety of products and projects in the Talend Cloud ecosystem, with a focus on Stitch and Smart Services. The Smart Services project aims to build features and enhancements that make users more productive across Talend Cloud. We build systems that capture and anonymize usage data and then build recommendation, forecasting, and automation features on top of that data.
As a Software Engineer, you’ll be responsible for software design, implementation, testing, and operation. You’ll collaborate with other software engineers, quality assurance engineers, product managers, and product designers to participate in the full software development lifecycle – from product requirements, to software design, to testing and release.

The team uses Clojure, Java, Python, ES6 and React. We run on AWS. Experience with these technologies is not required but is considered a plus.

Most of our code is written through pair programming, and you should expect to spend most of your time collaborating closely with other engineers on our team.
In the next year, we expect to:
· Continue to rapidly expand our universe of source and destination integrations
· Integrate tightly with the Talend Cloud platform
· Launch our product in new AWS regions
· Scale our data processing infrastructure to handle rapid growth in customers and data volume
· Add powerful new features to give users even more control over their data

What You’ll Need
To be eligible for this opening, you should have:
· Familiarity with basic data structures and algorithms
· Knowledge of web applications, databases, Linux and cloud environments
· A track record of delivering substantial software projects in cloud or SaaS products
· Excellent communication and interpersonal skills
· While it’s not required, it would be a plus to have recent experience with Java, Clojure, or Python.
