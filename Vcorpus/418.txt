Summary

The Department of Community and Human Services values diverse perspectives and life experiences. The Department encourages people of all backgrounds to apply, including people of color, immigrants, refugees, women, LGBTQ, people with disabilities, veterans, and those with lived experiences.

The Department of Community and Human Services (DCHS) provides equitable opportunities for people to be healthy, happy, self-reliant, and connected to community.

DCHS manages and oversees contracted community agencies providing programs and services for behavioral health prevention and treatment, housing and community development, individuals and families experiencing homelessness, youth and adult education and employment, veterans, older adults, women's program services and developmental disabilities.

DCHS is committed to making data-informed programming and investment decisions. A key component of this is to be able to explore and demonstrate impact of unique combinations of services that may span funding and programmatic boundaries. We are investing heavily in data systems to collect more robust client-level outcome data as well as in the data infrastructure to more easily combine data across sources and service systems. This opens opportunities for more robust analytics, as well as challenges of data management and governance.

The incumbent will also be responsible for identifying and solving data development needs related to identified research priorities and championing and shepherding the use of DCHS' newly created integrated data hub, which currently consists of data on homelessness services, behavioral health, and Medicaid, and is slated to expand in the coming year.

The position works in the Performance Measurement and Evaluation (PME) Unit as a member of flexible evaluation teams that design and implement program evaluation and performance measurement; conduct research; construct, refine and analyze measurement data sets; and report findings to stakeholders. This position requires significant collaboration with internal and external stakeholders. This posting may be used to fill other similar career service positions.
