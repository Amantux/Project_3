Position Description The Data Scientist II role is to wrangle data into a usable form, moving the interpretation of the data from descriptive and diagnostic into building prescriptive and predictive algorithms to solve Ryder's toughest problems. A Data Scientist will drive Ryder toward the cutting edge of what comes next. The Data Scientist is expected to be an expert of algorithms and knows the balance of the Art of Modeling. This position will work on cutting edge data technology by being a key user on Ryder's Azure Data Lake driving the analytics initiatives as an expert in this field. The Data Scientist II will use their skills as an expert of machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms, by utilizing the perfect blend of data with the right use-cases to turn Ryder's data into concrete value-add for the business. On this team, a Data Scientist will get the chance to be the machine learning expert, collaborating with Data Engineers and Analysts, using all their skills in order to exploit data to drive the business forward. The Scientist pushes the envelope of what is possible in the big data space; streaming live data into a data lake and experimenting with data in the data sandbox. As discoveries are made, the Scientist helps facilitate the movement of the algorithms into a core solution to support the business.
