Consider solving for large scale supply chain problems in ever changing and rapidly growing cloud environment. Consider working in a fast-paced infrastructure capacity planning team driving process and modeling innovations that span the entire infrastructure planning lifecycle - capacity experience, flow path modeling, inventory modeling, risk modeling and simulations. What do you have? - In a nutshell, you have the best Operations Research role bar none.

We are part of Microsoft Capacity Customer Experience (CCE) team and our vision is to deliver the best capacity customer experience by intelligent and proactive management of all Microsoft cloud capacity.

You will be responsible for coming up with creative capacity experience strategies to optimize capacity to provide the best experience for our customers at the lowest cost. This position will focus on identifying, building and analyzing opportunities to improve inventory models, postponement strategies, capacity availability and assurance models, risk models and simulation methods in order to improve prediction of short and long-term capacity planning needs. The successful candidate will be a person who enjoys and excels at diving into data to analyze root causes and implementing long term solutions in systems or processes. This position offers opportunity for immediate impact through model updates in our systems and creation of effective metrics and functionality.

The successful candidate will be an industry leading, hands-on senior Data scientist/Operations Research practitioner with a proven history of driving critical research and operationalizing cutting edge thinking to realize opportunity. The qualified candidate will have experience implementing numerical optimization methods designed for inventory and supply-chain network optimization.

Responsibilities

Some of the key job responsibilities:

Own the strategic planning and research initiatives involved with capacity experience modeling, risk modeling and process improvement and sizing up opportunities from new initiatives. Build prototypes to demonstrate the benefits from proposed changes to the decision systems and operational processes.

Partner closely with business and engineering groups. Provide analysis using mathematical modeling tools to benchmark existing operations/processes as well as to identify opportunities for improvement. Work closely with engineering teams in enhancing the prototypes and implementing them in our production environment.

Effectively communicate with senior management as well as with colleagues from computer science, operations research and business backgrounds.
