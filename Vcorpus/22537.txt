An early career job that will rarely be the same day-to-day. The role requires left and right brain problem-solving. The role works mainly within Information Security, at all organizational levels, but could span all areas of the CME as well. The role relies on Interpersonal and communication skills, with the goal of building and maintaining trusted working relationships. The role works in close coordination and oversight with all members of the Delivery team. Organization, attention to detail, flexibility, self-direction and critical thinking are a must as well as an ability to recommend a path forward - your input and views are required, not optional. Lovers of routine, risk adverse order-takers and advocates-of-the-status-quo are not meant for this role.
