Data Scientist 
 If you are a Data Scientist with experience, please read! 

We are seeking a highly skilled data scientist who is going to design and develop our AI platform to create a new AI-driven wireless network operations paradigm for customers of our industry-first converged wireless edge platform. In this role, you will be working with highly skilled designers, product managers and other engineering peers. You will also be involved in the solution design from the conceptual stages through the development cycle and deployments.     What You Will Be Doing 
 As a key member of a small team, you will develop robust, scalable AI pipelines at the core of our predictive analytics platform.

-You will use your expertise in mobile networks, AI and big data analytics to come up with novel solutions for optimizing end-to-end application performance in a variety of scenarios. You will build PoC systems to demonstrate these.
-You will work closely with the production software team to architect your models for efficient integration into a production environment.   What You Need for this Position 
 -Ability to map application experience to wireless network and core network KPIs, recognize issues in the mobile networks that could lead to degraded application performance
-Ability for choosing the best-fitting technique for data at hand from a repertoire of advanced machine learning techniques (like CNN, RNN, LSTM, Deep RL) and classical machine learning tools (nonlinear regression, support vector machines, random forests, and ARIMA)
-Intuition into computational performance and parallelizability of models for translating designs into scalable implementations and trading accuracy for efficiency when needed
-Strong team player capable of working in a demanding start-up environment

Desired Qualifications:
