We believe that a great writing experience is fast, outcome-focused, and alive with your ideas. Going from start to finish on a document in three minutes. Knowing who will respond to anything you've written before you even press send. Writing software that puts your ideas at the center, with language that is certain to land the way you want. Textio has already changed the way that thousands of companies write and now we are looking for a creative and curious data scientist to join us.

We're looking for a Senior Data Scientist who is passionate about analytics to lead Textio's quantitative understanding of our users, our product, and our business. In this role you will work with a top-notch team of data scientists, engineers, product managers, and others to define and execute on a roadmap for analytics at Textio.

Your work will drive insights that power strategic company decisions and product direction. You will quantify the quality and impact of current and future Textio features, create our end-to-end analysis workflows, turn ad-hoc insights into data products, and deliver impact directly to customers through your analyses. Your influence will span from our user behavior analytics to our predictive platform to the stories that Textio shares with the world.

You will be joining a welcoming and collaborative data science team at a company that deeply understands the value of data. Textio is a phenomenal place to build, learn, experiment, and deliver impact as a data scientist. Come join us!

What you'll be doing:

Partnering with colleagues across our organization to understand Textio's analytics needs and developing a roadmap to address them

Leading the design, creation and maintenance of self-service analytics/BI solutions and the data sources and pipelines that back them

Developing product instrumentation, metrics, and experimentation capabilities to support the evolution of Textio's superb augmented writing experience

Converting business questions into analyses, executing these analyses, and translating results into operational, product, and customer impact

Collaborating with business partners to provide information and quantify or reduce uncertainty in the face of limited data

Strengthening the analytics expertise of Textio's data science and related teams through mentorship, partnership, and technical leadership

We'd love to hear from you if:

You have experience building analytics/BI solutions that synthesize data from a variety of sources and serve end users in multiple business functions

You have a demonstrated history of mentorship and technical leadership. You enjoy investing time into the growth of your colleagues

You are comfortable working in ambiguous problem spaces, but you can map a path to increased clarity and independently take concrete steps along this path

You create practical analytical solutions that are guided by business context and the contours of the relevant, available data

You enjoy discovering and articulating the narrative in a data set, using your skills of data exploration, statistical inference, and visualization

You love building repeatable analyses that are precise, interpretable, and inventive

You thrive in an environment that believes that prototypes speak louder than specs

You take pride in the things you create

You demonstrate a track record of trying and learning new things

You're able to communicate your point of view but are low ego

We want to work with awesome and innovative people who can help us use data to make Textio the best that it can be.

Textio embraces diversity and equal opportunity in a serious way. We are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. The more inclusive we are, the better our work will be. If there is anything we can do to create a more comfortable interview experience for you, please let us know.
