AI SCIENTIST

Grab’s AI Accelerator team enables new features and products for Grab with innovations in AI. We develop and apply deep learning and machine learning to our large-scale datasets and wide-ranging applications. We foster a culture where we enjoy raising the bar constantly for ourselves and others, and that strongly supports the freedom to explore and innovate. We are looking for impact in the short term as well as long term.

Get to know the role:

 Develop and apply algorithms for computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine learning to solve business problems

 Own end-to-end implementation, system building and customer delivery of AI features

 Integrate, simulate and test impact of algorithms and features on the overall system

 Design and build machine learning and optimisation algorithms efficiently

 Develop and execute analyses, simulations or A/B tests to validate models and identify improvement opportunities

 Store, retrieve and visualise results in a manner that facilitates required analyses

 Design and build data ingestion and featurization

 Drive product improvements and roll-out of new features

 Effectively communicate with business/product stakeholders

The Must Haves:

 Ph.D. or Master’s in Computer Science, Electrical/Computer Engineering, or related technical disciplines

 Minimum 2 years of relevant experience in one or more of the following:

o Deep Learning

o Natural Language Processing

o Computer Vision

o Speech recognition

o Recommender Systems

 Proficient with machine learning tools such as TensorFlow, pytorch, statistical programming in languages such as Python and R; and strong working knowledge in RDBMS such as PostgresQL or MySQL

 Excellent software development capabilities, preferably in C++, Java or Python; knowledge of GoLang would be an advantage

 Self-motivated and independent learner who is willing to share knowledge with the team

 Efficient and detail oriented time manager who thrives in a dynamic and fast-paced working environment
