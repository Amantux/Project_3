Want to help the largest global telecom enterprises derive business value through the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)? Excited to help customers define use cases for massive amounts of disparate data to develop ML models? Eager to learn to apply ML to a diverse array of telecom use cases? Thrilled to be a part of Amazon who has been pioneering and shaping the worlds AI/ML technology for decades?

At Amazon Web Services (AWS), we are helping large enterprises build ML models on the AWS Cloud. We are applying predictive technology to large volumes of data and against a wide spectrum of problems.

AWS Professional Services team members leverage their deep knowledge of AIML and AWS technologies in collaboration with our sales and partner teams to propose, architect, and implement transformational solutions for customers. Helping make customer success a reality using AIML as an enabler and seeing the impact in real-time drives our teams to explore new frontiers in leveraging AWS for our customers.

The AIML Customer Delivery Architect (CDA) is a growth role within the Professional Services umbrella, and is principally oriented around a qualify-deliver-manage model. The CDA is responsible for partnering with Telecom Industry Professional Services leaders to dive deep into a customers business challenge, to collaboratively propose and qualify a particular set of outcomes, and lead a project/program to ensure high-value, predictable, and successful delivery.

A successful candidate will be a person who enjoys diving deep into data, doing analysis, discovering root causes, and designing long-term solutions. It is an individual with a unique hybrid of AWS platform expertise and hands-on building, coupled with cross-industry business acumen, including a heavy dose of passion for continued knowledge acquisition and growth, obsession for customers, and their success using AWS that will align well with the desired outcomes to be produced.
