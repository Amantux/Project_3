Facebook's mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together. Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities — we're just getting started.

Facebook is the second largest online video platform in the world. Video at its heart is a social experience, as people talk about and talk through video. Users upload their own videos. They go Live and broadcast to their friends. Pages upload tens of millions of hours a day.

Watch is the place on Facebook where people watch these videos and interact with their friends around them. It is one of the fastest growing parts of the app. We have recently grown to over 400 million 1-minute monthly users and over 75 million 1-minute daily users, who spend on average more than 20 minutes on Watch.

This role is focused on better understanding the Watch ecosystem, both around video producer behavior and around video consumer behavior. That includes better understanding the types of videos we have (classification by different content types and publisher types), better understanding the types of user engagements and interactions we have, and better understanding the impact of video watching on our users. There's a huge opportunity to improve the quantity and quality of the content we have on the platform and a huge opportunity to improve the experience and well-being of users.
