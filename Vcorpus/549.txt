Req ID: 26338

Shift: Days

Employment Status: AF - Active - Regular - Full Time

Job Summary

Perform exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling in pediatric biomedical research using machine learning, statistical, and mathematical analysis incorporating heterogeneous and complex data types independently based on milestone assignments from senior staff.

Contribute to assessing and implementing computational, algorithmic, and predictive analytics approaches to address assigned biomedical research questions in areas such as clinical decision support and population health surveillance

Contribute to the experimental design, execution, test and critical evaluation of methods as applied to translational data science research projects.

Use a flexible, analytical approach to extract optimal value from biomedical data.

Contribute to design and conduct of continuous validation plans for production systems that incorporate models and algorithms, providing guidelines and support for large-scale implementation.

Contribute to the creation, adoption, and adherence to best practice methodologies for performing data analysis and predictive modeling experiments.

Job Responsibilities

Implement computational algorithms and experiments for test and evaluation; interprets data to assess algorithm performance.

Make significant contributions to the formulation of analysis plans and associated documentation of methods that meet stringent criteria for reproducibility and measures of significance.

Develop high-quality code implementing models and algorithms as application programming interfaces or other service-oriented software implementations.

Participate in communication of research methods, implementation, and results to varied audience of clinicians, scientists, analysts, and programmers.

Work closely with applications research group to translate models and algorithms into engineered production applications.

Contribute to manuscript writing for results publication, authors abstracts, and presents at professional conferences.
