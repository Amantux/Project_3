Sema4 Genomics is seeking a talented, self-motivated individual to participate in leading edge research in translational bioinformatics as a member of the R&D bioinformatics group. Successful applicant will be part of an interdisciplinary team that develop and apply computational methods and databases to analyze large-scale human cancer clinical data and available genetic data in electronic medical records (EMR) to better understand treatment responses and clinical outcome in cancer patients in order to improve cancer care. Successful applicant may also play a role in developing systems for integrating novel informatics tools and methodologies into clinical practice.

Responsibilities:

Perform oncology clinical research of treatment response and clinical outcomes through analysis of cancer real world data (RWD).

Execute RWD analysis using EMR data, registry data, claim data, and publicly available data sources such as SEER.

Ensure latest methodologies and analytical techniques are implemented.

Generate high quality, readily interpretable deliverables (e.g., data tables, graphs, charts, study reports).

Integrative analysis of structured and unstructured EMR data to develop predictive models for treatment response and clinical outcome.

Effectively communicate research findings internally and externally. Publish research results in major oncology conferences and clinical oncology journals.

Provide consultation on all internal RWD studies including objectives, study design, data source identification, protocol development, statistical analysis and interpretation.

Requirements:

Extensive hands-on experience in computational analysis of clinical data in observational studies, prior experience in analyzing hospital-linked EMR data preferred

A track record of leading clinical research projects using rigorous statistical and computational approaches

Outstanding programming skills in R, Python, and/or perl, extensive experience in SQL

Strong knowledge of Unix shell scripting

Prior experience in analyzing genomic and genetic data preferred

Broad knowledge of cancer biology, clinical oncology, cancer drug discovery preferred

Strong ability to collaborate with teams of research scientists, bioinformaticians, software developers, and external collaborators

Qualifications:

3+ years with PhD in Biomedical Informatics, Biostatistics, Computer Science, Computational Biology, Genomics, or Genetics

3+ years in Computational Analysis of EMR data

4+ years in R, Python and Perl

4+ years SQL

3+ years in Cancer Biology, Clinical Oncology or Cancer Drug Discovery
