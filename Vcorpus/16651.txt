Karius is a venture-backed life science startup focused on transforming the way infectious diseases are diagnosed. Combining Next-Generation Sequencing and proprietary data analysis, we can identify over 1,000 pathogens from a single blood sample with typical turnaround time in one business day. By unlocking the information present in microbial cell-free DNA, we're helping doctors quickly solve their most challenging cases, with a future vision of accelerating clinical trials, discovering new microbes, and reducing patient suffering worldwide.

Position Summary:
We are seeking a candidate to work in a rapid, iterative research environment at the interface of our analytics, molecular biology, and medical teams. You will use rigorous quantitative reasoning to analyze and design experiments that allow us to understand more deeply, troubleshoot, and improve our existing and future assays. You will combine clinical and genomic data to gain novel insight into the interaction between pathogens and disease. This role sits at the heart of where important decisions are made about our technology, and a creative and energetic candidate will have the opportunity to shape the future of our assays and infectious disease medicine!
