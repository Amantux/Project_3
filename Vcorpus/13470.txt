ArsenalBio is building a programmable cell therapy company to create highly effective accessible immune cell therapies to impact outcomes for a much broader number of patients, initially those with cancer. Founded in 2019, ArsenalBio is focused on integrating technologies such as CRISPR-based genome engineering, scaled and high throughput target identification synthetic biology, and machine learning to advance a new paradigm to discover and develop in immune cell therapies.

Our approach requires novel receptors to empower cell therapies to sense their environment and respond as needed to resolve disease states. This role in ArsenalBio’s Synthetic Biology group lies on the forefront of development and application of those novel synthetic receptors. In it, you will interface closely with colleagues across ArsenalBio’s Research, Development and Technology organizations, as well as external collaborators and thought leaders.
What You Will Do:
Lead the development and optimization of synthetic immune receptors and related proteins for a portfolio of cell therapy applications
Develop and apply methods for pooled and arrayed high-throughput functional screening of large protein libraries in primary immune cells and cell lines
Develop DNA constructs and libraries encoding immune receptor domains, variants and fusions from rational, semi-rational and randomized designs
Dissect and model the biochemical and functional characteristics of select receptor designs
Work with interdisciplinary teams to establish and test novel cell therapy approaches
Provide expert support for synthetic biology and protein engineering work across our broader scientific team
Maintain familiarity with the relevant current literature and its application to protein engineering, synthetic immunology and cell therapy
Coordinate tasks across multiple projects, demonstrating prioritization and planning
Interpret and effectively execute experiments in line with project timelines and goals
Recruit and mentor junior scientists and research associates with relevant expertise
What You Will Bring:
PhD in molecular biology, immunology, protein engineering or a related field, with 3+ years of relevant research experience in industry or academia
Experience with high-throughput functional characterization of DNA and protein libraries in pooled and/or arrayed formats
Experience developing/optimizing protocols for nucleic acid cloning, amplification, modification and analysis
Experience optimizing/developing protocols for DNA assembly and library construction for synthetic biology and protein engineering
Working knowledge of vector design for gene expression, genetic reporter systems and genome engineering applications
Working knowledge of NGS technologies and workflows
Entrepreneurial behaviors demonstrated by agility, accountability, transparency, resourcefulness, and ability to get things done
Ability to quickly learn new skills and knowledge on the job, demonstrate productivity, and deliver high-quality results
Flexible mind with ability to think outside the box, creative approach to problem solving, and comfort in working with ambiguous data in an open-ended, exploratory process
Demonstrated ability to perform as a team player
What We Hope You Might Bring:
Familiarity with R or similar environments for pipelining of routine data analysis
Collaborative experience with computational biologists and/or software engineers to help develop and use novel tools for construct design, experimental planning and/or data analysis
Experience with multiplexing/barcoding approaches for scaling experimental throughput
