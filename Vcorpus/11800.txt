Our Houston Research Center focuses on research and innovation in geology, geophysics, reservoir engineering, production technology, drilling, and sensors development to advance the discovery and recovery of oil and gas. Located in Houston?s Energy Corridor, the center neighbors the nation?s leading petroleum engineering universities, labs, manufacturers, and service companies. 
Basic Function 
Develop algorithms, models and prototype solutions to address challenging scientific and engineering problems for exploration and production (E&P) applications.  Serve as a bridge between machine learning (ML), data science and subject matter applications. 
Duties & Responsibilities  

Develop machine learning algorithms and perform advanced statistical analyses of engineering data to obtain insights into trends and opportunities  

Develop and maintain appropriate databases  

In close collaboration with research and business partners in the US and in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, offer mathematical, computational and statistical models from the collected data to automate, augment, improve or speed up human decisions  

Research and deliver proof of concepts solutions, responding to clear and specific business needs  

Serve as a bridge between machine learning/data science and subject matter applications  

Bridge the gap between prototype development and scalable production applications when needed  

Develop proper unit test frameworks for artificial intelligence (AI) and ML and provides high level documentation  

Communicate appropriate algorithm research and prototype development best practices back to the machine learning group, to improve learning and future capabilities  

Publish and present work in journals and at conferences  

Develop and maintain statistical reports and visual presentations for management    

Perform other duties and participate in special projects as assigned   
Education and Experience  

Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Applied Mathematics & Statistics, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, or Geosciences required; Master?s degree and/or Ph.D. strongly preferred  

Must have at least three (3) years of relevant experience in data science including at least two (2) years in AI or ML  

Strong fundamental understanding of various modern machine-learning methods or computational physics/geosciences/chemistry background, along with significant machine learning knowledge is desirable  

Ability to:  

compile, correlate, and compute results from large data sets  

develop machine learning algorithms and perform advanced statistical analyses  

effectively collaborate with research and business partners across disciplines and cultures  

demonstrate technical writing skills and develop logical and clearly defined reports and presentations  

make oral/graphic presentations to collaboration partners  

show a history of active participation in technical society activities preferred  

Proficient with business software applications     

Experience in a few of the following areas: deep neural networks, reinforcement learning, Markov Random Fields, Bayesian networks, semi-supervised learning, computer vision, image processing, signal processing, distributed computing, and/or numerical optimization  

Substantial programming experience is expected, preferably in Python  

Experiences with one or more of the following is highly desirable:  familiarity with ML frameworks such as Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch, MXNet, operationalizing ML models, cloud computing (e.g. Google Cloud, AWS, etc.), GPU computing environment  

Experience with big-data technologies such as Hadoop/Spark is a plus  

Experience in oil and gas application is a plus.  

Must be able to comprehend and communicate accurately, clearly and concisely in English   
NO THIRD PARTY CANDIDATES ACCEPTED
