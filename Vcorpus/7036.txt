Your day-to-day

As a Cybersecurity Data Scientist, you be part of a team to design and build email detection solutions in a fast, collaborative process. You will iterate quickly, operate on evidence and evolve as you learn. You are biased towards action, pragmatism, and results.

Participate in a creative, enthusiastic, and geographically-distributed team responsible for identifying and responding to spam attacks launched against some of the World's largest ISPs, web hosting providers, and mobile network operators.

Perform deep analysis of spam message headers & structure to identify novel spam features, and design rules to detect those features.

Work closely with Engineering, Support and Technical Services teams to supply customers with a multipronged strategy to defend against malicious messages.

Collaborate in the design of software to respond to new attacks, with a focus on automation to ensure that new threats are stopped quickly.

Perform in-depth analysis of tactics used to circumvent detection to create fast, effective techniques against high volume attacks.

Participate in defining the landscape, prevalence, and evolution of messaging abuse, by documenting emerging threats and trends, and by contributing to future product requirements.

Create reports and perform in-depth data analysis using Splunk, Google BigQuery, SQL and other tools.

Develop tools to aid and streamline analysis activities.

What you bring to the team

Natural curiosity and ability to work with minimal guidance, while collaborating across multiple, geographically distributed departments.

Can-do attitude with a focus on problem solving, product quality, and a strong desire to get the job done.

Strong written and verbal communication skills (in English), including the ability to convey highly technical information in an accessible manner, both in written reports and live presentations.

Knowledge of statistical analysis and data mining systems.

Familiarity with SQL and SIEM (Splunk, Kibana).

Familiarity with regular expressions and shell scripting.

Familiarity programming in Python, Golang, Perl, or other languages.

Rudimentary understanding of statistics (distributions, regression, probability).

Exposure to common data science libraries including NLTK, SpaCy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and/or Tensorflow.

Experience with Linux environments and command-line tools.

Familiarity with internet protocols (SMTP, DNS, TCP/IP) – mobile protocols a plus

Undergraduate or graduate degree in Computer Science, Cybersecurity, or Data Science, or equivalent experience

If you like wild growth and working with happy, enthusiastic over-achievers, you'll enjoy your career with us!
