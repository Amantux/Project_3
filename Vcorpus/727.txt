TITLE: COMPUTER PROGRAMMER/DATA SCIENTIST

DUTIES

This position involves computer programming for developing software for specific applications in agriculture, specifically with respect to nutrient dynamics in soil-plant-atmosphere continuum, spatial and economics application, and for the development and maintenance of an institutional database. Duties mainly include:

Interaction with scientists for design and the implementation of algorithms in a specific programming language for crop modeling, database development and management, and instrumentation (data capture),

Assist in the development, design and implementation of crop models, economic models, and databases (agronomic research, M&E, geographic and otherwise),

Assist in development of documentation for scientific use and publication (e.g., Training material for database users, user’s guide for crop simulation packages),

Maintain database results by setting and enforcing standards and controls. Prepare database expansion by studying plans and requirements; advising senior technical management; coordinating design and programming.

Manage improvements and upgrades in the database system focusing on ag data by developing policies and procedures.

Support IFDC staff in other research and training activities (e.g., Management of data, DSSAT training, etc.).

JOB REQUIREMENTS

Proficient oral and written communication in English;

Experience with one or more of the following computer languages: Delphi, Fortran, Java, Python, C/C++ to design and develop new software and effectively modify existing ones such as DSSAT, PRDSS and GSSAT, and to develop database management code;

Experience for development and administration of MongoDB databases and foundational knowledge of SQL;

Ability to work analytically to interact with scientists in the development of an institutional database and to turn concepts into code usable for database development/administration and research problems involving crop simulation models;

Ability to promote processes for improvement, data maintenance, and database management.

Ability to build and maintain database link within the organization and external data (AgMIP, GARDIAN).

Ability to develop programs to facilitate data processing, storage, and sharing (ontologies, semantic nets, and rules).

Minimum education requirement: Bachelor’s or Master’s degree with a major in Computer Science or Computer Information System with minimum 3 years of relevant experience;

Knowledge of basic agricultural sciences or related software development experience is highly desirable.

DIFFICULTY OF WORK

This position requires technical knowledge of computer programming, database management and capability to understand the general concepts to assist scientists in the solution of research problems. The Computer Programmer/Data Scientist works closely with the Fertilizer Research Program staff as well as with scientists from other organizations to modify existing code and to identify and develop concepts to be incorporated in the code of crop simulation models.

RESPONSIBILITIES

Continuing the development of the IFDC’s decision support tools, improvement of soil-plant-nutrient components of DSSAT, database, and support to scientists developing code with the purpose of improving the performance of existing simulation models. Work is generally assigned by the project leaders in the areas of crop simulation models and development/administration of the IFDC database. The project leaders provide detailed instructions and follow closely the progress of the work until it is completed. The incumbent must report promptly to the project leaders any difficulties to avoid errors that may result in loss of time, waste of resources, or misrepresentation of research results.

PERSONAL WORK RELATIONSHIPS

Most contacts are made with staff and clients to explain computer programs and obtain information required to develop new programs.

PHYSICAL EFFORT AND WORK ENVIRONMENT

This position requires working in a normal office environment with no unusual demands or exposure to hazardous situations. The Computer Programmer/Data Scientist is expected to travel occasionally overseas and within the United States to conduct training programs on decision support tools and database management and to participate in model development workshops.
