Facebook's mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together. Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities - we're just getting started.At the heart of connecting people together is building a platform that fosters sharing between you and family, friends, and community. Messaging is key to this. The messaging market is competitive with a wide range of competitors at different stages of development including 1) Messaging services built on social platforms such as Messenger/FB, Snapchat, Instagram 2) Standalone messaging apps such as WhatsApp, WeChat and Line and 3) Android/iPhone native messaging solutions such as iMessage and Android Messages.
