Position Description:

Expert in machine and statistical learning, probability, statistics

and mathematical finance.

Primary Objectives:

Introduce a proper methodology and process for building statistical

learning models under privacy-preserving constraints (typically

addressing direct customer requirements) with emphasis to models

for mathematical finance and other industry verticals (healthcare,

manufacturing, adtech).

Major Areas of Responsibility:

Build and compare various statistical learning models, first in

plaintext (via tools such as numpy, sklearn, datarobot, etc.)

and evaluate which of these perform well and can be adapted

to the XOR Engine privacy-preserving computational setting.

Introduce a process-oriented methodology to building

prediction models on data coming from multiple private data

sources (data cleaning, feature engineering, model building)

via hybrid approaches of local computations at each side and

the use of XOR Engine.

Clearly communicate prediction problems, requirements and

limitations to data analysts on the customer end, including the

cryptographic limitations. Take specific problems from

customers.

Educate a team of data analysts who would implement and

test the necessary functionality and models (on the Inpher

internal DSL as well as HYPPOCAMPUS)

Outreach goals: contribute to educational tools for privacy-

preserving data analytics (online mini-course, webinars) for the

larger community explaining both the cryptographic and

machine-learning approaches.

Contribute with original research on privacy-preserving data

analytics.

Requirements

Background:



PhD in mathematics / computer science

Previous experience in statistical learning and/or mathematical finance, preferably as a quantitative analyst in either a large bank or a hedge fund.

Strong knowledge in cryptography, statistics and finance
