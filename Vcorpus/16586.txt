Who You Are


Making sense out of complex data is core to our business at Quantifind and we're looking for talented Data Scientists to join the team. At Quantifind, we look to integrate large amounts of data from diverse data sources (structured financial data or unstructured social data) to drive important business decisions for large brands. We research the latest NLP algorithms to make text searching more efficient and we are able to pinpoint meaningful signals from vast amounts of signals including text, demographics, and interest groups. We algorithmically determine users' demographics based on their language features and interests. And we draw causal conclusions on the financial impact of marketing campaigns from some household known brands. Underneath it all, we have proprietary data infrastructure built in-house where Data Scientists can experiment with new algorithms instantaneously. You are also encouraged to build finished data science products end-to-end: you will develop your own algorithms in our production pipeline!

Who We Are


Quantifind is a uniquely positioned data science and human insights company. In our primary application, we offer marketing decision-makers Explanatory Analytics that help them better understand their customers' interests and priorities. We are currently building out a new vertical aimed at financial crimes risk management including anti-money laundering (AML) and fraud detection. Our advantage is existing science, engineering, and SaaS product capabilities that align very well with the technology needs.

To help you succeed, we provide a supportive environment that fosters collaboration between teams and team members, where learning and professional growth is considered a key part of your success, and of ours. We offer a flexible work environment with a family-friendly work-life balance, catered lunches three times a week, and fun team activities to keep you healthy, happy, and stress-free.
