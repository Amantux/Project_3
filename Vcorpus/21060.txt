This role will augment staff for our application team partners to help them reach their Enterprise Data Governance compliance. The consultant will be doing one of two functions based on experience and background. 1) Completing business data dictionaries (metadata) primarily in excel spreadsheets, some of which may be quite complex. We have roughly 300 applications that this will need to go through validation of whether a data dictionary exists. When it does not, or does not meet the policy compliance, the contractor will need to ensure completion and validate results with their assigned domain manager. Experience in completing metadata and/or data traceability is required. 2) Assessing that data quality measures adequately meet the Enterprise Data Governance compliance expectations. The contractor does not need to write data quality rules or implement higher standards. Only assess the current measures in place. A background in data quality, metadata, and/or data governance is required
