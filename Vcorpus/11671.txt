The Role – Data Scientist We collect a lot of data. To date we have over 10 million images from various deployments in the field in several countries. We have over 400,000 labeled ground truth examples of threats, and many more data points of where the AI and an operator disagreed. We are also starting to gather every decision that an operator makes - when they zoom in, what they highlight as suspicious, etc. As a Data Scientist, you would contribute insights that would be core to the product itself and help improve our core algorithms. You would also sift through data to help customers understand their own facilities better and how Syntech ONE impacts operations. You would assist in generating data that would go into written reports delivered to customers after trials, and periodically for ongoing deployments. ‍ KEY RESPONSIBILITIES: Analyze the training and test images to understand the nuance differences between all the image statistics and their impact on the model performance - the goal of this effort is to improve the detection rate and FPs and eventually build a more robust model that supports multiple x-ray machines Build an analytics dashboard - a huge project and potentially a standalone product that helps us (and clients) get deeper insights on their security facility Explore data to uncover trends, patterns, and quantifiable impacts that our system has at a particular deployment. WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR: 3+ years of industry experience in data science Expert knowledge of scientific computing in Python and SQL Strong knowledge of statistics (clustering, regression, etc.) and experimental design Experience working with machine learning algorithms (supervised and unsupervised learning) Familiarity with traditional image processing techniques WHAT WOULD REALLY IMPRESS US: Expertise with Jupyter notebooks and Pandas Comfortable setting up and using BI tools Experience with ETL tools and building / maintaining a data warehouse
