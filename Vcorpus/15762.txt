Job Number: R0085562

Data Scientist, Mid

The Challenge:

Are you excited at the prospect of unlocking the secrets held by a data set? Are you fascinated by the possibilities presented by machine learning, artificial intelligence advances, and IoT? In an increasingly connected world, massive amounts of structured and unstructured data open up new opportunities. As a data scientist, you can turn these complex data sets into useful information to solve global challenges. Across private and public sectors-from fraud detection, to cancer research, to national intelligence-you know the answers are in the data.

We have an opportunity for you to use your analytical skills to improve the DoD and federal agencies. You’ll work closely with your customer to understand their questions and needs, then dig into their data-rich environment to find the pieces of their information puzzle. You’ll develop algorithms, write scripts, build predictive analytics, use automation, and apply machine learning to turn disparate data points into objective answers to help our nation’s services and leaders make data-driven decisions. You’ll provide your customer with a deep understanding of their data, what it all means, and how they can use it. Join us as we use data science for good in the DoD and federal agencies.

Empower change with us.
