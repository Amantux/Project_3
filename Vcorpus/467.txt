The Challenge:

Are you excited at the prospect of unlocking the secrets held by a data set? Are you fascinated by the possibilities presented by the IoT, machine learning, and artificial intelligence advances? In an increasingly connected world, massive amounts of structured and unstructured data open up new opportunities. As a data scientist, you can turn these complex data sets into useful information to solve global challenges. Across private and public sectors — from fraud detection, to cancer research, to national intelligence — you know the answers are in the data.

We have an opportunity for you to use your analytical skills to positively impact your government. You’ll work closely with federal agencies to understand their questions and needs, then dig into their data-rich environment to find the pieces of their information puzzle. You’ll develop algorithms and apply machine learning techniques by combining tools and frameworks to turn that set of disparate data points into objective answers to help senior government leaders make informed decisions. You’ll provide them with a deep understanding of their data, what it all means, and how they can use it. Join us as we use data science for good in modernizing our government.

Empower change with us.
