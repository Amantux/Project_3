DATA & ANALYTICS AT MARS PETCARE

The Petcare Segment consists of five Divisions: Pet Nutrition, Royal Canin, Mars Veterinary Health N. America, Mars Veterinary Health International & Diagnostics, Kinship. Under this new organization of Petcare Product and Service brands, we launched our Strategy in 2018 with an objective to "Create a Better World for Pets by extending global leadership in Nutrition, Health and Services powered by Data".

With the breadth and scale of our Petcare businesses we have unique and unrivaled data assets. The potential to create benefits for Pets and sustainable competitive advantage is huge and we need to seize this opportunity now.

Our data assets consist of Veterinary data including appointment and invoice details as well as the medical histories and diagnostic details this provides. We have breed and disease marker data from our DNA diagnostics business (Wisdom Health), Location and Activity Tracking data from our Whistle business. From our nutrition businesses we have sales data, some consumer data as well as valuable information about retailers, Veterinarians, Breeders and Shelters. We also have third party data providing us with product purchasing insights and the potential to develop deeper and broader views into Petcare shopping through collaboration and D2C engagement.

We began our work to leverage these more strategically to power our ecosystem in 2018 and there is a core team at the Petcare level incubating and guiding these efforts.
