Flipside Crypto is seeking a Data Scientist to identify and explore patterns in massive amounts of blockchain and developer data and to contribute to our growing body of research on cryptocurrency. Flipside Crypto is located in Boston, MA, but remote applicants will also be considered.

Who You Are:
You love data and stats. You know some formal statistics and data exploration techniques
You are fastidious and meticulous in your work. You don't mind doing the “grunt work” to get the full picture
You're creative and you aren't afraid to be wrong. A lot.
You know your way around SQL-like databases (e.g. PostGres, Impala, MySQL)
You are intimately familiar with R and/or Python for analysis, exploration, and model-building
You take pride in your code. It's readable, functional, and reproducible
You can describe a complex problem (or solution) in a way that doesn't put people to sleep, and doesn't leave them scratching their heads
What You'll Actually Work on:
Work directly with the engineering and product teams to implement our Data Cooperative product, and build our industry-leading Intelligence solutions
Collaborate with other data scientists to explore, visualize, and validate our cryptocurrency data
Apply models to make our data sing and enable us to build meaningful products from it
Participate in brainstorming and strategic discussions of how to improve our methods, models, and products
Desired Experience:
Some prior experience as an analyst or data scientist, working directly with database-level data, whether formally or self-taught
Experience with Crypto is a big plus but not a requirement
Ideally at least 1-2 years in a data science or analyst role working in R or Python
Experience working with product teams, developers, and data engineers is a plus
