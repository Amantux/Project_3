Benefits of working at Convoy:

Health & Wellness: Taking care of your health comes first. Convoy covers 100% of your medical, dental, and vision premiums, and 85% for your family. We also provide access to the gym and showers in our building.

In-Office Happiness: Enjoy catered meals multiple times through the week, and fully stocked fridges and pantries to keep you running full.

Commuter Benefits: We transport the world; the least we can do is help get you to work. Every employee receives a fully paid Orca Card to get you around on the bus, light rail, or water taxi. We also provide locked bike storage if you prefer to pedal in.

Time Off: Life outside of work matters! Convoy has a flexible vacation policy, so take the time off you need- we don’t track vacation or sick time. We also offer generous parental leave for those expecting new additions to their family.

Compensation: We offer market competitive compensation, including stock options and a 401k plan to help save for retirement.

Convoy is an equal-opportunity employer and we are actively seeking a diverse team. If you're a collaborative analyst who wants to have an outsized impact with a small, tight-knit team, we'd love to hear from you!
