Are you ready for your next challenge?

Who you you? You are a smart, motivated business systems analyst who excels at the intersection of business and technology, synthesizing a sea of information (or sometimes a desert!) into clear requirements for colleagues in business and IT roles. You understand data and data management. You become a center of competency on any project you join and your colleagues find your organization skills awe inspiring. You coordinate conversations, document and diagram clarity, and drive progress.

Who are we? Wittij Consulting is a highly respected IT professional services company looking to add some more smart people to our team. We don't do any software development or infrastructure operations. What we do is provide expert services to our clients, from small regionals to Fortune 500, in support of two fundamental technology questions:

1. What should they do? (Enterprise Architecture and Planning)
How should they do it? (Solution Delivery).

Our mission is to help our clients get maximum value out of their technology investments.

With us, you would flex and grow your skills on diverse projects and clients working alongside like minded "multi-faceted" business systems analysts and IT architects.

Role will be a mix of remote and on site work. Some travel may be required. You must be authorized to work in the US and willing to undergo a background check in accordance with local laws and regulations.

Specific experience

In addition to traditional business requirements work, this role requires experience:
documenting data structures and dictionaries as well as mapping data between systems
producing data analytics and reporting
- defining data models is a plus
- testing and managing data quality is a plus.

The compensation for this role ranges (based on experience) from $60K - $110K, plus top notch benefits.
