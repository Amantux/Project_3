Preserving Trust in Amazon with every customer, every transaction, every second is our mission. We do this by identifying and removing bad actors from the platform, while supporting a best-in-class customer experience. Amazon has hundreds of millions of customers, sellers, and developers all over the world that rely on Amazon products and services. Our success comes from preventing bad actors from abusing these products and undermining the trust customers have in them. We are handling massive scale. Amazon's scale means that you'll be designing and developing custom distributed systems more advanced than those used in standard industry practices. They need to be highly available, low latency, high quality systems. Amazon is one of a kind in the number of customers served, transactions processed, and products handled.
Amazon.com's Buyer Risk Prevention (or BRP) protects the Amazon bottom line by preventing the bad guys like fraudsters, identity thieves and such elements from entering our front door. We've got the latest in machine learning algorithms, statistical modeling techniques and investigation tools but we need your help to keep Amazon.com safe. Youll be part of a team working to protect Amazons most important asset, its customers, from targeted attacks from humans and bots.
