Position Summary

This position is part of the Engineering team, which supports the manufacture of cutting-edge 3D woven carbon fiber composite parts for the LEAP family of aircraft engines. The Data Scientist is a technical expert with a broad set of responsibilities related to the collection, management, visualization, and analysis of part, process, and business data. It is a multi-disciplinary role that blends data, statistics, computer science, and engineering. Duties range from daily production support tasks to managing complex, long-term development projects.

Production support tasks typically involve helping process engineers find and anlyze data in support of investigations into process anomalies or parts defects. Projects vary in scope and may include creating or improving scripts that automate data collection and post-processing tasks, creating real-time data dashboards and reports, or creating web applications to improve both production and non-production processes. There is also ample opportunity to apply machine learning, deep learning, and other big data techniques to drive improvements and uncover valuable business insights.
