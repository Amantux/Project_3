About us:

We’re a small, scrappy data science team that is trying to change the culture at LexisNexis to be more data driven. We’ve already proved the value of AB testing, now we need to go to the next level. We need someone who understands product, user experience, and engineering, as well as serious data science chops. We’re looking for someone with a proven track record of delivering insights and using those insights to change the business in some meaningful way. This role is really about setting the direction of data-driven decision making at LexisNexis for years to come. Join us and we can really have a huge impact on how LN does business.

What we’re looking for:

Determination, focus, attention to detail, and motivation to succeed

The ability to communicate complex ideas clearly and succinctly

Experience with SQL, R and/or Python, and dashboarding tools

Experience with Elasticsearch, Tag Managers, Google Analytics (or similar analytics packages)

Experience designing tasks for crowdsourcing or human evaluation

Keen statistical sensibilities

The ability to explain why this is funny: https://xkcd.com/1132/ (or not)

Can see all sides of an argument and use data to settle the difference

Experience with machined learned models (can you see the random forest for the gradient boosted decision trees?)

Product experience

2+ years in industry

Masters+ in CS, Stats, Psychology, Economics, or some other field where you worked with lots of data

Proven track record of driving business outcomes through data
