Purpose of Job

This role will work with the innovation analytics team which supports new product development in auto and property. For auto, our focus is developing our telematics program by constructing dataset and analyzing them for insight into driver behavior and losses. For property we construct datasets from smart home devices to determine what value these internet linked sensors can offer insurers and their policyholders. The team is heavily involved in wrangling its own data; running models; testing new tools, methods, and environments; and interacting with partners in other departments to implement findings. The work is very non-routine.

Uses advanced techniques that integrate traditional and non-traditional datasets to enable analytical solutions. Applies predictive analytics, machine learning, simulation, and optimization techniques to generate management insights and enable customer-facing applications; Builds analytical solutions leveraging internal and external applications to deliver value and create competitive advantage; Translates complex analytical and technical concepts to non-technical employees.
