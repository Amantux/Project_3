*Job Description**
This position is for a Scientist in Data Science and Applied or Mathematical Statistics who will provide scientific and technical research within the National Security Directorate (NSD) supporting the data analytics capabilities of the Computational Analytics Division. The Scientist will develop and apply fundamental mathematical or statistical theory to advance analytic solutions in various scientific domains. The Scientist must be able to draw from a strong statistical background, in areas including experimental design, advanced statistical modeling (e.g. mixed linear models, nonparametric models, etc.), machine learning, and computer simulations, to recognize patterns, characterize uncertainty, and develop predictive models using structured and unstructured data. The Scientist will produce solutions driven by domain science and mathematical statistical science from complex and high-dimensional datasets and design, develop, and evaluate advanced algorithms that lead to optimal value extraction from data. In addition to technical research this position expects participation and career development in task management, proposal writing, business development, and publishing.

Operating on the data-information-knowledge continuum, staff at PNNL employ diverse methods to confront significant problems of national interest from distilling distributed data into knowledge that supports decision processes to enabling resilient technologies that enhance computing at extreme scales. Our research portfolio spanning from basic to applied includes statistical modeling and experimental design, applied statistics, applied mathematics, machine learning, operations research, optimization, and other advanced statistical and mathematical domains.

Computing researchers and practitioners work side by side to apply advanced theories, methods, algorithms, models, evaluation tools and testbeds, and computational-based solutions to address complex scientific challenges affecting energy, biological sciences, the environment, and national security. Core domain knowledge is beneficial, such as in the nuclear, biological, energy, materials, or chemical science spaces.
