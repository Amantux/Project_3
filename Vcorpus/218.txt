Job Description

Distributed technologies like solar photovoltaics, storage, and wind are changing the energy landscape. This position will join our distributed generation (dGen) modeling team as we strive to understand what drives consumers to place solar panels on their roof and batteries in their basements. We are looking for quantitative social scientists with interest researching distributed energy resources issues. NREL’s dGen model modeling tool is an agent-based model that relies on rich socio-economic and geospatial data to forecast the adoption and deployment of distributed technologies like solar PV. The dGen team is looking for a research analyst with a passion for big data, economics, consumer behavior, and rate design to join their growing team. Because this is an emerging research area, we are interested in applicants from a broad background. This position will require the successful candidate to participate in the development and execution of models, analysis of results, and publication of results in written reports and spoken presentations.

.

Basic Qualifications

Bachelors Degree in engineering or related or Advanced Degree in engineering or related Other basic qualifications are:

>1 semester of programming experience

>1 semester of model development

Masters: at least one publication; PhD: at least three publications

Relevant internship or work experience

Interest in DER topics (wide-ranging: DER adoption modeling, retail rate design, customer

behavior)

Experience developing statistical and/or machine-learning based models

Exceptional written and spoken communication skills

.

Additional Qualifications

General knowledge and application of engineering technical standards, principles, theories, concepts and techniques. Intermediate abilities and knowledge of practices and techniques. Good writing, interpersonal and communication skills.

Please include a cover letter that specifically points to your experiences and interests that are strongly aligned with this position.

Preferred Qualifications

Preferred candidates will have qualifications in any of the following categories:

Experience with energy-related customer behavior in a quantitative and/or research-based

environment

Experience developing agent-based models

Experience conducting spatial analysis (note: many students will have experience making a map in

GIS, we are looking for spatial modeling, spatial regressions, etc.)

Experience researching any of the following: retail rate design, DER integration

Experience working with "big data"

Experience with statistical models

Ok: used regression in a class project, took a basic regression course

Better: experience beyond simple ordinary least-squares models (OLS), e.g. logistic modeling,

discrete choice modeling; developed models independently for a publication/research or a

long -duration project

Wow: Experience with statistical modeling and machine learning (e.g. random forests, SVM,

neural networks); developed multiple models independently and applied them in a research

context.
