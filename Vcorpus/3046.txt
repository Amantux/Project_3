SUMMARY

The Data Scientist will use expertise in programming databases modeling statistics and visualization to analyze data at scale. This may entail querying databases data processing supervised and unsupervised machine learning deploying production models and communicating findings.

The Data Scientist is a thought partner assisting MAPMG to make strategic data-related decisions by analyzing and manipulating data and building models to assist in the clinical and operational setting. The primary focus will be on models used in the clinical care of patients. The Data Scientist works with team members physicians and managers and uses team collaboration and project management tools to monitor and manage the work.
