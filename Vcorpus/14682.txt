The RiceTec Data Scientist will need to Design strategies and implement algorithms to analyze and leverage data; assessing the effectiveness and accuracy of data sources to be used as inputs in data analysis; to implement visualization systems that make data readily available and simplify how insights are communicated.

This analysis will be used for detection of crop response to sync management techniques, fertilizers and other crop production inputs; development of crop and pest management aids based on aerial images in large production fields; validation of small plot data collected by aerial sensors with established ground-based information.

Analysis will also focus on identifying opportunities for new and existing weather models to create value in supply reliability; parent line production; crop management.

Results should translate production problems into data-driven analytics / machine-learning tasks and building related products which automate the operational functions in production and manufacturing areas.

Candidates should have experience in building advanced analytics models across one or more areas of Predictive/Prescriptive Analytics, and Image Processing; Expertise in analytical packages such as Python, R, Statistical packages like Statistica, Minitab; applied experience in various machine learning techniques (e.g. Neural Networks).

Requirements: Masters in Statistics, Mathematics, Machine Learning, Agricultural Statistics or Climatology. PhD is Preferred.
