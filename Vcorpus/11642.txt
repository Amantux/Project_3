Amazon Fulfillment Technologies (AFT) powers the physical engine at the heart of Amazon. AFT builds and operates software, hardware, and processes that run the global network of fulfillment centers that move many millions of units of inventory, employ tens of thousands of people, and ensure that customers get what they want when we promised we would get it to them. We do this by building automated solutions to handle things that technology does well, while relying on people to handle things that humans do well. Our environment is global and complex with a variety of software and systems, including industrial machines and protocols. We are constantly innovating in the ways we are automating and accelerating the delivery of products and packages which includes building custom software and hardware and applying robotics, computer vision, machine learning, image processing, and real-time data processing using distributed systems. Amazon Fulfillment Technologies is changing the way automated facilities are operated. We are building a next generation data collection, data processing, and event prediction technology pipeline to help maintain the performance of our facilities.
