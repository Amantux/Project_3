This is what you’ll do:
You’ll take the adventure of a lifetime. Rivian is pushing the boundaries of what can be done in a vehicle; you’ll help us do that. You’ll work with a team of top-notch engineers and scientists to build in-vehicle tools tracking vehicle performance and reliability metrics. You’ll create a framework for monitoring and assessing vehicle health that has never been done.
· Build ground-up models to predict vehicle wear and need for service based on vehicle diagnostic signals
· Work closely with engineers to scale physics-based models from a vehicle prototype to entire Rivian fleet
· Develop models describing vehicle and drive unit performance based on manufacturing assembly data
· Create performance-based metrics and acceptability thresholds at the edge
· Work with available in-vehicle signals to provide early detection of unique wear mechanisms
· Create the foundation for a data driven, edge-based fault detection platform that will run on all Rivian vehicles
This is what you’ll need:
· Awesomeness
· Passion for building an amazing product
· Interest in working on a unique team with diverse technical backgrounds to create a ground-breaking vehicle application
· MS/PhD in Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, or related field
· 3-5 years experience working with hardware systems, automotive preferred
· Excellent Python and/or R programming skills
· Strong experience with weakly supervised and unsupervised learning methodologies
· Strong ability to work and communicate with many different teams of stakeholders
· Ability to own all project data science needs, while collaborating with firmware and mechanical engineers working alongside you; ability to thrive in a close-knit cross-functional environment.
· Experience with mechanical and/or audio systems preferred
· Excellent communication skills, ability to explain complex concepts to non-data science teammates
This is where you’ll work:
