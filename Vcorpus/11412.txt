Sema4 is a health information company founded on the idea that more information, deeper analysis, and increased engagement will improve the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. A Mount Sinai Health System venture based in Stamford, Conn., Sema4 is enabling physicians and consumers to more seamlessly engage the digital universe of data, from genetic test results and clinical records to wearable sensor metrics and more. The company currently offers advanced genome-based diagnostics for reproductive health, oncology, and pharmacogenomics, and is building predictive models of disease biology. Sema4 believes that patients should be treated as partners, and that data should be shared for the benefit of all.

Sema4, is seeking a Data Scientist to join Clinical Informatics team to develop and study novel approaches in translational medicine, or the application of analytic and interpretive methods to optimize the transformation of integration of EMR and multi-omics data of many types into proactive, predictive, preventative, and wellness. Our goal will be advancing novel diagnostics, therapeutics, and insights into both diseases and wellness; with the aim to deliver clinical applications into practice and help clinicians work more efficiently and bring impact to improve patient outcomes. We are developing innovative new features within and alongside the frameworks and clinical applications utilized in the comprehensive big data domain. The right candidate will work with software engineers and other data scientists in the Clinical Informatics team, and others in R&D including bioinformatics and product teams in a multidisciplinary environment.
