Dave is the finance version of David and Goliath taking on the big banks. A financial friend to the millions of Americans who use the app. Dave helps with budgeting, building credit, finding work and accessing money to cover immediate expenses before payday. Instead of mandatory fees, Dave lets users pay what they think is fair through a ‘tip’ based model. Dave users plant a tree for each % tip they leave when taking an advance, resulting in tens of millions of trees planted.

We are choosing to build a quality team vs a large team. You will be a formative part of our company culture moving forward. To that point, we want someone that can take ownership of a project from beginning to end and can do it on their own. We’ll be there to support you but not hold your hand.

Sure, we’ve checked all the boxes you’d expect from a fast-moving startup, but the best thing we can offer you is a supportive environment for learning and opportunities for personal/professional growth.

We are looking for a curious data analyst to help inform Dave’s marketing decisions, using data backed explanations. You will work directly with other data teammates to empower the marketing team to be the most efficient and effective Marketing team in Los Angeles. We’re looking for someone who is a driven, analytical, a self starter, obsessed with marketing spend efficiency, and will love being part of our close-knit team.
