Our mission at Progenity is simple: to help healthcare providers and patients prepare for life. We provide the most advanced molecular technology and the highest levels of service to guide patient care at critical life stages. We continually seek people with the motivation and skills to advance our mission.
As a key member of our Device Development team, the Principal Electrical Engineer is responsible for designing, developing, modifying and evaluating electronic parts, components or integrated circuitry for electronic equipment and other hardware systems. Determines design approaches and parameters. Analyzes equipment to establish operating data, conducts experimental tests and evaluates results. Selects components and equipment based on analysis of specifications and reliability. Development includes process from pre-concept through architecture definition, development, verification, transfer, and product manufacturing. In support of device realization, development and manufacturing aids are also created and deployed. Further RF linked satellite devices may be employed. The successful Electrical Engineer has the strong engineering, scientific, and regulatory knowledge. This Electrical Engineer shall work well both individually and tightly with other software, electronics, and mechanical engineers in rapid development of novel medical devices.
