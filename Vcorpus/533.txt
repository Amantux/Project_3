What you will be doing

The Finance group at AmerisouceBergen is looking for a data scientist interested in working with financial data, ordering data, and other third party data to answer questions about sourcing, pricing, and distributing pharmaceuticals across the United States.

In this role, you will be combining company and external data to answer questions with a financial focus. These problems could include segmenting customers by purchasing behavior, modelling customer profitability and lifetime, forecasting financial metrics on the scale of months or years, predicting win/loss rates in contract negotiations, and building machine learning processes that monitor and provide feedback on how or where to improve predictive models already deployed.

Individuals within the Data Scientist role work closely with business stakeholders, Financial Analysts, Data Engineers, Data Visualization Specialists and other team members to turn data into critical information and knowledge that can be used to make sound organizational decisions. They need to be creative thinkers and propose innovative ways to look at problems by using data mining (the process of discovering new patterns from large datasets) approaches across a wide range and variety of data assets. They will need to validate their findings using an experimental and iterative approach. Also, Data Scientists will need to be able to present back their findings to the business by exposing their assumptions and validation work in a way that can be easily understood by their business counterparts.

Data Scientists are responsible for using analytics techniques to model complex business problems, discovering insights and identifying opportunities through the use of statistical, algorithmic, mining and visualization techniques. In addition to advanced analytics skills, Data Scientists are also proficient at integrating and preparing large, varied datasets, implementing specialized database and computing environments, and communicating results.

Individuals in this role need a combination of business focus, strong analytical and problem solving skills and programming knowledge to be able to quickly cycle hypotheses through the discovery phase of the project. Excellent written and communications skills to report back the findings in a clear, structured manner are required. Also required are the ability to establish and maintain effective working relationships with team members, as well as an innate curiosity around wanting to understand business processes, business strategy and strategic business initiatives to help drive incremental business value from enterprise data assets.

Improve organizational performance though the application of original thinking to existing and emerging analytic methods, processes, products and services, and employ sound judgment in determining how innovations will be deployed to produce return on investment.

Working with business stakeholders identify business problems, opportunities and/or initiatives for which analytics models may provide insights that can contribute to or drive the development of an approach or solution.

Conceptualize, design and develop analytics models in addressing complex business problems, discovering insights and identifying opportunities that are of value to internal and external business stakeholders, typically using a hypothesis-driven approach.

Working with Data Engineers determine how to best source data, including identification of potential proxy data sources, and design business analytics solutions, considering current and future needs, infrastructure and security requirements, load frequencies, etc.

Where appropriate help seed data science capabilities within business functions, essentially developing “citizen data scientists” within the business teams.

Show strong team building and creative thinking skills, and a desire to “make a difference
