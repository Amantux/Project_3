The Challenge:

Are you excited at the prospect of unlocking the secrets held by a data set? Are you fascinated by the possibilities presented by IoT, machine learning, and artificial intelligence advances? In an increasingly connected world, massive amounts of structured and unstructured data open up new opportunities. As a data scientist, you can turn these complex data sets into useful information to solve global challenges.

We have an opportunity for you to use your leadership and analytical skills to improve Booz Allen’s commercial practice. You’ll work closely with clients to understand their questions and needs, then dig into their data-rich environment to find the pieces of their information puzzle. You’ll mentor teammates, conduct data analysis and modeling, design data-driven solutions and approaches for clients, and use the right combination of tools and frameworks to turn that set of disparate data points into objective answers to help our commercial security clients make informed decisions. You’ll provide your customer with a deep understanding of their data, what it all means, and how they can use it. Join us as we use data science for good in commercial Cybersecurity.

Empower change with us.
