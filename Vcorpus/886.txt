Cotiviti is looking for an industry leading Data Scientist Team Lead focused on machine learning solutions to join a revolution in Healthcare Technology and build value-oriented, production level machine learning solutions. As a team lead this role should appeal to experienced data scientists who enjoy the role of mentoring data scientists and managing the work effort to make the team successful, while still maintaining a hands on role with their own machine learning initiatives. This role is not for the research oriented data scientist, but rather should be of interest to those that want to apply their knowledge and experience to real world problems, and seek to utilize Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to reduce the cost of healthcare and improve health quality and outcomes. Cotiviti’s Machine Learning and Strategic Analytics team consists of data scientists, engineers and data analysts dedicated to developing and implementing robust, scalable, value-based solutions on our proprietary machine learning platform that uses a blend of best in class vendor solutions, together with custom built capabilities where gaps in the market exist. With access to a dedicated Hadoop based multi-node cluster the team can work with a vast amount of structured and unstructured data including claims, membership, physician demographics, medical records and others to begin to solve some of the most pressing healthcare issues of our time. A Data Scientist Team Lead at Cotiviti will be given the opportunity to work directly with a team of healthcare professionals including analysts, clinicians, coding specialists, auditors and innovators to set aggressive goals and execute on them with the team. This is for an ambitious technologist with the guts, flexibility, and personal drive to succeed in a dynamic environment where the individual is judged based on their direct impact to business outcomes.

Responsibilities:

As a Data Scientist Team Lead in the Machine Learning and Strategic Analytics team within Cotiviti you will be responsible for delivering solutions that help our clients identify payment integrity issues, reduce the cost of healthcare processes, or improve the quality of healthcare outcomes. You will be assigned a number of projects to complete, and lead small teams of data scientists to develop solutions as well as complete some projects yourself. You will be expected to follow processes and practices that allow your models to be incorporated into our machine learning platform for production execution and monitoring, however, initial exploratory data analysis allows for more flexible experimentation to discover solutions to the business problems presented.

Work with a data scientists, data science management, business operations and product management to assess the potential value and risks associated with business problems that have the potential to be solved using machine learning and AI techniques.

Develop an exploratory data analysis approach with your teams to verify the initial hypothesis associated with potential AI/ML use cases.

Once verified, develop in depth EDA to create models that meet or exceed the thresholds required to deliver on the use case.

Develop requirements for features required in your final model and interact with the feature library team to get your features built into the library.

Document your approach, thinking and results in standard approaches to allow other data scientists to collaborate with your work.

Prepare your final trained model using features within the feature library and develop a validation test set for QA.

Work with production operations to deploy your model into production and support them in monitoring model performance.

Participate in other data science teams collaborating with your peers to support their projects

Participate in knowledge sharing sessions to bring new insights and technologies to the team.

Participate in design sessions to continuously develop and improve the Cotiviti machine learning platform

Provide feedback on data scientist performance and development opportunities, help guide data scientists in the training, review their work, and report progress of initiatives to management
