Job Description

We, at Flywire, are looking for a smart, analytical thinker who’s excited to empower data-driven decision making at an exciting and fast-growing organization! As a Data Scientist, you will need to possess the unique set of skills that allows you not only to design and implement stable, reliable, and productive data science solutions, but also identify the areas of the business where these solutions would be most helpful.

The Data Scientist will be a part of a small, nimble, and multifunctional team and will therefore need to be comfortable working at all levels of the data science pipeline: from data collection, to data manipulation, to model building/tuning, to presentation of results, and ultimately deploying models into production. Great technical aptitude is a must for this role, but we’re also looking for someone that’s willing to work across Flywire teams to understand real business problems and design solutions that will ultimately provide insights into the performance of the company, improve process efficiencies, and contribute to our company’s ability to provide a world-class cross-border payment solution.

Key responsibilities:

Drive Flywire’s ongoing efforts to integrate machine learning and data science into our products and services in order to gain a deeper understanding of the drivers behind our business and create a more efficient and productive payments solution

Interact with teams across the organization to identify opportunities for general efficiencies and improvements that can be made through the usage of data, including optimizing international funds flows, predicting payer conversion, and forecasting client volume

Contribute to the development of production-grade data pipelines and ETL processes to support analytics projects, business intelligence reporting, and machine-learning solutions

Manage the ongoing development and maintenance of anomaly detection algorithms to rapidly detect potential issues in data quality or important business metrics

Collaborate across teams to optimize internal operations and international funds flow

Qualifications

BS in Computer Science, Mathematics, or related field

Experience in building and deploying production-grade machine learning algorithms

Experience in building data extraction and manipulation scripts in Python and/or R

Strong SQL experience. Database management experience is strongly preferred, particularly with Redshift and/or Google BigQuery

General understanding of the broader data landscape, trends, and emerging technologies. Hunger and excitement for learning new tools and techniques

Excellent problem solving skills. You may not know the solution to all the problems you’ll face, but you have the ability to research available technologies/strategies and figure out a solution or a path forward

Strong communication skills: You can make even the most complex data and technical problems easy to comprehend

Preferred Criteria:

Experience in international finance and/or the payments space

Experience in Business Intelligence development (Tableau, Looker, etc.)

Demonstrated ability of building streaming data applications

Familiarity with Apache Spark, Docker, Airflow

Additional Information

With over 30 nationalities across 9 different offices, and diversity and inclusion at the core of our people agenda, we believe our FlyMates are our greatest asset, and we’re excited to watch our unique culture evolve with each new hire.
