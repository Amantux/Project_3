Do you want to apply your data science and computational skills to exciting new research problems? Do you have a background in research but love to write code and analyze data? If so, then we have an exciting opportunity for you.
Princeton University is building a community of data scientists to work in partnership with its world-renowned faculty and students to help solve data-driven research problems. You will work with faculty in a collaborative, multidisciplinary environment and actively contribute your skills to advance scientific discovery. You will have access to Princeton's first-class resources, the opportunity to co-author academic publications, to offer short courses and workshops on data science, and to collaborate with, and learn from, the larger computational data science community.
Three research areas are of particular interest. Catalysis: led by the Department of Chemistry; Biomedical Data Science: led by the Department of Computer Science; Technology Policy: led by the Center for Information Technology Policy.
Prior experience in one of the above areas is an asset but is not required. You will be mentored in the relevant research area. If you have a strong background in scientific programming, academic research, and are eager to contribute to groundbreaking research, you have the right skill set. These are 3-year appointments offering a very competitive salary and excellent opportunities for growth and career development. The positions are part of the Schmidt DataX project, an initiative made possible by a major gift from Schmidt Futures.
