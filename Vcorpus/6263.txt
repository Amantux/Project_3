We seek a creative and collaborative data scientist to develop, evaluate, and apply novel methods of data integration of multimodal profiling data to enable translational research for drug discovery and development. The successful candidate will work at the cutting edge of science to solve important challenges in biomedical research, assessing, integrating, curating, and mining complex data to drive biological/clinical insights. The data scientist will play a key role in an interdisciplinary team of translational research/medical scientists, biologists and computational scientists. • S/he will develop and employ novel approaches to derive and evaluate inferences across diverse data types to identify novel drug targets, biomarkers and therapeutic mechanisms in hepatology, nephrology and other areas of unmet medical need. The focus will be the interrogation of large molecular profiling datasets, including aptamer-based multiplex proteomics, to enable precision medicine. • The position requires nimble analytic skills and combining an understanding of biological sciences with computational techniques in statistics and mathematics. • A team-oriented focus is required. • The candidate will participate in alliances with external partners at top healthcare institutions and has the opportunity to publish her/his work.
