Position Overview/Description  

Ford's Global Data, Insights and Analytics team is seeking a  Systems and Simulation Data Scientist.  Our team is charged with digitally transforming the business that has evolved over the last 116 years into a highly complex system. Given this level of complexity, our task is uniquely challenging. Optimizing any individual piece of the system often leads to sub-optimizing the overall system. 

The Systems and Simulation Data Scientist role is critical to analytically connect systems that were historically thought of as individual silos as well as building out simulations to understand the cause and effect of proposed solutions. You will have the opportunity to work with some of the best and brightest in the field and be at the forefront of the data science movement that is transforming the automotive industry.
