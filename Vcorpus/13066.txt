Senior Scientist, DMPK

Agios (agios.com) is a biopharmaceutical company committed to applying our scientific leadership in cellular metabolism to transform the lives of patients with cancer and rare genetic diseases. We are growing rapidly with an active research and discovery pipeline across both therapeutic areas. Agios has two approved oncology precision medicines and multiple first-in-class investigational therapies in clinical and/or preclinical development.

Agios Pharmaceuticals is searching for a dynamic Senior Scientist to join our growing drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK) team. The Senior Scientist will be responsible for working with various contract research organizations (CROs) for designing and analyzing in-vitro/in-vivo absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) studies and addressing issues related to metabolism and drug-drug interactions for both discovery and development programs. The ideal candidate will have a proven ability in identification of biotransformation pathways and metabolic enzymes/drug transporters involved in disposition of new therapeutic agents. A successful candidate should be able to exhibit strong communication and interpersonal skills and desire to work in a fast-paced, flexible and dynamic environment.

Key Responsibilities
Design and execute in vitro and in vivo (preclinical and clinical) drug metabolism/ADME studies in support of discovery and development programs
Metabolic soft-spot identification and assessment reactive pathways to guide medicinal chemistry efforts in lead discovery and optimization
Elucidate biotransformation pathways and determine the role of metabolic enzymes (cytochrome P450 [CYP] & non-CYPs) and drug transporters involved in the disposition of new chemical entities
Identification of drug interaction liabilities due to enzyme/transporter substrate/inhibition/induction and set-up exclusion criteria in first-in-human trials
Provides leadership in clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) study design based on clearance pathways, phenotyping and alteration of metabolic enzymes/drug-transporters activity
Serve as a subject matter expert in drug metabolism and DDIs with in DMPK/Clinical Pharmacology

The candidate should have extensive experience interpreting mass spectral (LC-MS) data and other structural elucidation techniques such as NMR, chemical derivatization etc.
Strong knowledge in clinical relevance of clearance mechanisms and role of enzymes (CYPs & non-CYPs) and transporters in drug metabolism is required
Thorough understanding of metabolism and DDI regulatory guidelines is an asset
Ability to work independently with a minimum supervision, design experiments and report data in written reports and team presentations as required
The individual is also expected to be highly organized, a team player, enthusiastic about drug discovery, and possess strong communication and collaborative skills
Preferred Qualifications
Experience in conducting non-radio-labeled and radio-labeled ADME studies is preferred
Hands-on experience in translational PBPK modeling to predict pharmacokinetic based drug interaction is highly desirable
Publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals are desirable
