Data Scientist

Description:


A data scientist will develop machine learning, data mining, statistical and graph-based algorithms to analyze and make sense of data sets; prototype or consider several algorithms and decide upon final model based on suitable performance metrics; build models or develop experiments to generate data when training or example data sets are unavailable; generate reports and visualizations that summarize data sets and provide data-driven insights to customers; partner with subject matter experts to translate manual data analysis into automated analytics; implement prototype algorithms within production frameworks for integration into analyst workflows.

Data Scientist shall possess the following capabilities:
Produce data visualizations that provide insight into data set structure and meaning
Work with subject matters experts (SMEs) to identify important information in raw data and develop scripts that extract this information from a variety of data formats (e.g., SQL tables, structured metadata, network logs)
Incorporate SME input into feature vectors suitable for analytic development and testing
Translate customer qualitative analysis process and goals into quantitative formulations that are coded into software prototypes
Develop and implement statistical, machine learning, and heuristic techniques to create descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics
Develop statistical tests to make data-driven recommendations and decisions
Develop experiments to collect data or models to simulate data when required data are unavailable
Develop feature vectors for input into machine learning algorithms
Identify the most appropriate algorithm for a given data set and tune input and model parameters
Evaluate and validate the performance of analytics using standard techniques and metrics (e.g. cross validation, ROC curves, confusion matrices)
Oversee the development of individual analytic efforts and guide team in analytic development process
Guide analytic development toward solutions that can scale to large data sets
Partner with software engineers and cloud developers to develop production analytics
Develop and train machine learning systems based on statistical analysis of data characteristics to support mission automation
