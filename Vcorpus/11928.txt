Position Overview:

The Climate Corporation’s mission is to help the world’s farmers sustainably increase their productivity with digital tools. The Climate Corporation leads the industry in connected acres, and the rapidly growing volume of on-farm data, in combination with other large data resources, are opening new opportunities to deploy advanced computational and machine learning methods to help farmers increase their productivity and improve the sustainability of their practices.

In order to take advantage of increasing amounts of agricultural and genetic data, the Climate Corporation is seeking an experienced, self-motivated and hands-on computational geneticist to join Genetics Modeling Team. You will focus on identifying appropriate datasets and developing machine

learning models by integrating genetic and pedigree data into crop modeling frameworks to understand key drivers of yield performance for various cropping systems.

Basic Qualifications:

Ph.D. in Computational Genetics, Crop Genetics, Plant Science or other related life science discipline

Expertise in the field of crop genetics and statistical genetics (QTL, GWAS, GWS, GBLUP and MAS) with very strong computational skills

Minimum of 2 years industrial work experience in building machine learning models with crop genomic data, pedigree information, complex phenotype and other agronomic data

Fully proficiency with Python, R, SQL, C/C++, Linux/Unix

Experience with database, data wrangling, statistical models, quantitative genetic methods, machine learning algorithms and their proper application to different genomic data

Passionate about extracting quantitative insights from genomic data and apply them to crop modeling frameworks

Preferred Qualifications:

Extensive experience in crop disease and other key agronomic traits

Experience with cloud platforms such as AWS, Domino

Experience in Deep Learning algorithms and framework

Strong analytical, effective and creative problem-solving ability to develop quick yet sound solutions to resolve complex issues

Strong organizational skills and inclination to work in multi-disciplinary environments, and desire to see ideas realized in practice

Good interpersonal and communication skills

What You Will Do:

Develop innovative computational approaches to various types of genomic data by integrating the other data and interpret analytical results

Apply machine learning techniques to automate a large genotype-phenotype dataset analysis

Develop code to implement analysis workflows in a robust and reproducible fashion

Work with data scientists and engineers to build real time models and maintain the datasets from which models are created

Partner with scientists in Climate teams and R&D organization to support crop models

Explore new technologies in genomic research and apply them in projects

Assist with high-level analysis, design, and code reviews
