Job Description
Training machine learning models over billions of data points.
Quantifying predictive uncertainty using probabilistic and Bayesian methods.
Creating models that quickly generalize to new tasks using few-shot and meta- learning.
Training agents that execute decisions to optimize a reward over time.
Implementing state-of-the-art model-based planning and reinforcement learning algorithms, including offline and off-policy methods that learn from human demonstrations.
Scaling machine learning systems to massive datasets using big data technologies such as Spark and Hadoop.
Building visualization and data exploration tools that automate the analysis and debugging of machine learning models.
Experience Required
Masters or PhD in computer science, or equivalent.
4+ years of work experience.
Strong programming and problem-solving skills.
Deep knowledge of machine learning, including both supervised and reinforcement learning.
Specific subfields include deep learning, probabilistic and Bayesian methods, few-shot and meta- learning, model-based planning, and imitation learning.
Proficiency with the Python machine learning stack, including numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, tensorflow, keras, pytorch.
Experience with reinforcement learning, model-based planning, and/or control theory is a plus.
