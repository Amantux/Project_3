Contributing to and leveraging agency and federal data analytic resources

Communicating EPA data analytic activities to staff and management through briefings, conference presentations, and training sessions

The participant will be part of a multi-disciplinary and/or cross-program team. The participant will be trained by a mentor who will introduce them to EPA scientists and leaders in IT that support environmental science and policy. Additionally, the participant will have the opportunity to be trained on the development of methodologies to be used in all phases of IT project management.
