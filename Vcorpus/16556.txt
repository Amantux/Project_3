2+ years applying deep learning methods using frameworks such as TensorFlow, mxnet, Torch, Caffe, and Kaldi.
Strong background in at least one area of machine learning, such as deep learning, ASR, NLP, robotics, computer vision, gesture recognition, multimodal fusion, etc.
Publications in research communities such as NIPS, ACL, ICML, CVPR, etc.
Excellent algorithm and data structure skills (time and space complexity analysis, optimization, etc).
Expertise in Python with some experience in C/C++ development.
Demonstrated ability to quickly learn and modify large, existing code bases.
Skill in efficiently implementing algorithms published in technical papers and/or developing new algorithms.
Enthusiasm for continuing to learn state-of-the-art techniques in machine learning.
Excellent interpersonal and collaboration skills.
Description
