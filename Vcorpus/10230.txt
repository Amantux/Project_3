Performs research on current and future HPC, data, and CI technologies, hardware and software projects. Works on algorithm development, optimization, programming, performance analysis and / or benchmarking assignments of moderate scope where the tasks involve knowledge of data science and bioinformatics.

MEDICINE / CARDIOLOGY / ARNAOUT LABORATORY

The Arnaout laboratory studies deep and machine learning for biomedical imaging and related clinical data, with the goals of decreasing diagnostic error and developing and scaling novel phenotypes to drive precision medicine research.

UCSF is a top-10 medical center and a leader in cross-campus efforts to mine, harmonize, and analyze multi-modal clinical data for the University of Californiaâ€™s 15 million patients.

The Arnaout laboratory is part of both the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute, where the abovementioned efforts are based, and the nationally ranked Department of Medicine (DOM). Projects focus on deep learning for medical imaging, and through collaborative work with intra- and inter-institutional partners, touch the electronic health record, genetics, and other sources of data.
