We believe that the future of business writing is knowing how a document will perform before it’s published. Textio has already changed the way that thousands of companies write, and now we are looking for creative and curious data scientists to join us.

You will be joining a welcoming and collaborative data science team at a company whose core products are fueled by data analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning. As a company, Textio deeply understands the value of data. This is a stellar place to deliver impact as a data scientist.

Your work will form Textio’s core understanding about our users, our product experiences, and the analyses that fuel our augmented writing technology. Your insights will power strategic company decisions and product direction, and they will be developed in partnership with people in many different roles within the company. Your influence will span from our user behavior analytics to our predictive product components to the stories that Textio shares with the world.

Textio is a phenomenal place to build, learn, and experiment. Come join us!

What you’ll be doing:

Partnering with colleagues across our organization to translate business questions into analyses, and analyses into operational and product impact.

Pairing with Textio’s data storytellers to ensure clarity, accuracy, and richness in the narratives that Textio shares with the world.

Leading the creation and maintenance of self-service analytics solutions and the data sources that back them.

Developing product instrumentation, metrics, and experimentation capabilities to support the evolution of Textio’s superb augmented writing experience.

Translating insights from your analytical work into product features.

We’d love to hear from you if:

You love building repeatable analyses that are precise, interpretable, and inventive.

You can find the narrative in a data set, using your skills of data exploration, statistical inference, and visualization. Your approach to analysis is iterative and guided by a desire to discover and learn.

You view data anomalies as invitations rather than nuisances. You take the time to understand the scope, value, limitations, and nuances of a data set before you draw conclusions from it.

You can think creatively, but you let practicality guide you in getting things done.

You enjoy collaborating with people in many roles, and learning about a range of business and data domains.

You have the technical skills to explore and analyze data independently, and the self-awareness to ask for input when appropriate.

You take pride in the things you create.

You demonstrate a track record of trying and learning new things.

You have a point of view but are low ego.

We’re not looking for ninjas or rockstars. We want awesome and innovative people who can help us use data to make Textio the best that it can be.

Textio embraces diversity and equal opportunity in a serious way. We are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. The more inclusive we are, the better our work will be. If there is anything we can do to create a more comfortable interview experience for you, please let us know.

Working at Textio is outstanding. Learn more about our philosophy, benefits, and team at https://textio.com/careers/. Reach out and share your story with us!
