About Us

Pinto is a smarter food data platform, designed for the needs of today's consumers in the world of personalized diet. To do this, we're rapidly bringing the world of food online and making it personalized across every dietary need and preference — everything from general diets like Vegan, Paleo, Keto, Heart Health, and Mediterranean, to the long tail of ingredient and allergen considerations like Lactose Free, Gluten Free, Nut Free, and No Added Sugars. Over 40% of Americans now follow a specific dietary eating pattern, and our data platform is organizing the world of food at scale with partners that include Whole Foods and Kroger.

For businesses, we work with industry partners (retail/CPG) to 1) rapidly digitize large product inventories and 2) organize these inventories across every granular need and preference that matters to a modern consumer — from every allergen and intolerance to the long tail of diets (like Paleo, Gluten-Free, Keto, etc.), conditions, certifications, nutrition preferences and much more.

Current retail partners include Whole Foods, Kroger, and more. Learn more about Pinto and the technologies we power: http://business.pinto.co
