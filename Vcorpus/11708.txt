THE PURPOSE:

The Applied Data Scientist will be part of Machine Intelligence & Analytics Department. This team works closely with all other teams to develop, deliver and maintain data driven products and backend analytics platforms for the discovery, interpretation, communication, and exploitation of meaningful patterns in data. In addition, this team will develop and maintain an analytic pipeline for acquisition, storage, and processing data types of interest to feed real-time artificial intelligent system behaviors. The Machine Intelligence & Analytics Department will architect data systems supporting machine learning applications, develop custom toolchains for analysis and exploration, and work with DevOps and IT to host and scale intelligent applications.

Ultimately, we will design reliable, scalable, real-time (or near-real time) applications that make Hyperloop a reality. We are seeking candidates with various levels of experience to join our team of qualified, diverse individuals at our Los Angeles facility.

THE ROLE:

Perform extract, transform, and load operations on large datasets from many complex, heterogeneous data sources

Explore, interpret, and analyze datasets for patterns of interest and opportunities for incorporating data driven machine intelligence to vehicle, transportation, and logistics software systems

Research, evaluate, and determine the best fit of analytical tools and techniques

Develop or modify existing machine learning tools and libraries as needed

Develop visualizations of key parameters and relationships to provide insight into data and underlying system.

Develop, evaluate and adapt advanced machine learning algorithms to transportation and logistics problem domain

Design and create data mining architectures/models/protocols, statistical reporting, and data analysis methodologies

Enhance, scale, and deploy real-time analytics capabilities, models, and visualizations within production environment on production compute architecture

Develop metrics and evaluation criteria to characterize and quantify system performance and benefits of machine intelligence

Develop, update, and maintain design specification and end user documentation

Collaborate in a fast-changing environment and to communicate clearly and effectively with colleagues who range from data scientists, developers, dev ops, hardware engineers, and product managers.
