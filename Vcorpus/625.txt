The Position

The Position

As an Associate Data Scientist/Data Scientist within our Personalized HealthCare (PHC) Analytics function, you will work with meaningful Real World Data (RWD) to generate impactful evidence and insights on our molecules/medicines and patients, that support R&D, advance scientific and medical knowledge, and enable personalized patient care and access. You will collaborate with peers within the function and across the organization to develop evidence generation strategies, identify real world healthcare data sources (electronic medical records, insurance claims, patient registries, biobanks, or survey data) and design and execute analyses to address molecule and disease area questions. You need to have a good understanding of RWD, observational research and advanced statistical methodologies as well as strong hands-on analytical expertise and scientific understanding. You will also need strong collaboration and communication skills, as well as an entrepreneurial mind-set, to transform RWD into valuable clinical insights to inform decision making and help support our patients.

Responsibilities

Be an expert in RWD: Have detailed knowledge of real-world data sources including electronic health records (CPRD), insurance claims (Marketscan), hospital data (Premier) and disease registries. Have familiarity with each data source limitations and be able to appropriately apply the data source for conducting observational research.

Be an expert in methodology: Stay current with and adopt advanced analytical methodologies, tools and applications to ensure fit-for-purpose and impactful approaches. Understand the underlying principles of the data science and statistical methodologies and ensure applied appropriately.

Produce high quality and rigor analyses: Lead, develop, and execute high quality RWD analytics solutions using appropriate methodologies, tools, and best practices and ensure compliance with applicable pharma industry regulations and standards. Communicate findings to internal stakeholders.

Interpret and share results: Communicate findings to internal stakeholders, regulatory,health technology assessment (HTA) bodies and scientific communities, publish results, or presenting your insights in the meeting or forum.

Dive into Data: Develop a comprehensive and deep understanding of the data we work with and foster learning with colleagues using analytical tools and applications to broaden data accessibility and advance our proficiency/efficiency in understanding and using the data appropriately

Identify evidence needs & solutions: Ask the right scientific questions, understand the evidence needs for research and development, regulatory and market access, and ideate and make recommendations on fit-for-purpose data and analytics solutions.

Collaborate & Shape: Collaborate and contribute to functional, cross-functional, enterprise-wide or external data science communities, collaboratives, initiatives or goals on knowledge-sharing, methodologies, innovations, technology, IT infrastructure, processes, etc. to support business.
