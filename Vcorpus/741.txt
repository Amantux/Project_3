About the Center for Data Science

The Center for Data Science at RTI International is seeking an Entry Level Data Scientist with skills in programming, natural language processing, data visualization, machine learning, AI, mathematical and simulation modeling, forecasting, text analytics, and social network analysis. To be candid, we’re not looking for entry-level data scientists, we’re looking for entry-level software engineers who are interested in data science and could potentially grow into a data scientist role.

RTI is one of the nation’s largest independent, nonprofit scientific research organizations with a mission to improve the human condition. Furthermore, our Center for Data Science’s mission is to apply “data science for social good” by combining modern software development with data science in the domains of health, criminal and social justice, public safety, survey science, engineering, and the environment. A successful candidate will work with a thriving team of 20+ RTI data scientists, statisticians, software developers, artists, and subject matter experts across RTI solving important national problems, improving our local communities, and transforming research

Our goal is to solve problems and inform decision-making through collaboration, innovation, user-centered design, rapid prototyping, an open source mindset, and technical expertise.

Responsibilities

Collaborate with a team of data scientists, statisticians, software developers, artists, and subject matter experts to solve problems using data science approaches, techniques, and methods.

Collect, clean, store, organize, integrate data, and create data pipelines.

Perform descriptive and exploratory analyses, predictive modeling, machine learning, simulations, text analytics, social network analysis, and interactive data visualization.

Assist in expanding data science business: participate in meetings with clients (internal and external), assist in framing projects and designing solutions based on client needs and problems to be solved.

Create internal and publicly available data products and tools.

Communicate results through presentations and reports for clients, internal staff, scientific journals, and contributions to open source projects.

Assist teams in proposal writing.

Participate in professional development and scientific stature efforts.

Qualifications

Degree (bachelors) in computer science, or data science

Zero or more years of relevant experience (relevant internships in lieu of years of experience).

Strong interpersonal and collaboration skills, including oral and written communication and presentations as evidenced by publications or cover letter.

Experience with Python and its data analysis ecosystem (pandas, scikit-learn, numpy)

Experience with data ETL processes (e.g. SQL queries, reading flat files (CSV/JSON), data cleaning).

To qualify, applicants must be legally authorized to work in the United States and should not require now, or in the future, sponsorship for employment visa status.

Desired Skills/Experience:

Ability to access, extract, integrate, create pipelines, and analyze data from a wide variety of sources (e.g., relational databases, text and unstructured data, sensor data, social media data, image and video data, streaming data).

Experience with any of these: text analytics, social network analysis, natural language processing

Experience with machine learning, deep learning, and/or predictive modeling.

Ability to quickly and easily learn new open source software.

Experience with static and/or interactive data visualization methods.

Experience navigating and scripting in a Unix command line environment.

Experience with containerization technologies (Docker).

Collaborative software development experience, including familiarity with version control, testing, code reviews, and/or Agile software development.

Experience with a compiled programming language (e.g., C, C#, C++, Java).

Experience with web front-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks, such as React and Vue.js.

Experience with web back-end technologies, including frameworks such as Node.js/Express, Flask, and/or Django.

Familiarity with SQL and NoSQL databases, including any of these: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB, and Neo4j.

Experience in cluster and cloud computing environments.
