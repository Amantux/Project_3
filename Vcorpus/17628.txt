abstractions

· Collaborate with
product management and engineering departments to understand
company needs and
devise AI powered solutions

· Build tools that
will increase the productivity of the Data Analytics team-members
developing AI-based systems

· Implement models
that the data science team develops into working prototypes,
proof of concepts,
self-supporting model ecosystems

· Build data pipelines
that contribute to a self-sustaining data model system

· Build demos and
conduct training in conjunction with data scientist to help the
broader
engineering organization (and/or business partners) effectively
