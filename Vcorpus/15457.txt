Join the Spark Team

We were born of innovation, springing from the curiosity, imagination and dedication of remarkable scientists and healthcare visionaries. Our shared mission is to challenge the inevitability of genetic disease by discovering, developing, and delivering treatments in ways unimaginable – until now.

We don’t follow footsteps. We create the path.
Summary
The downstream process development (DSPD) team is seeking a highly motivated and innovative senior process scientist with diverse experiences in downstream process development. The candidate must have biopharmaceutical industry experience to develop, optimize, and characterize downstream processes. The successful candidate will participate in multiple downstream process development areas for adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector in both early screening stages and late DS/DP stages. The major responsibilities are described, but not limited to, as follows:

• DOE setup by implementing QBD for various column chromatography.

• Develop the scalable downstream process of AAV virial vectors and provide the technical development report accordingly.

• Systematic screen to optimize the cell harvest/ clarification and final UFDF process.

• Support external/ internal manufacturing process and participate troubleshooting as a SME.

• Maintain GXP compliant good documentation with high level of detail, close-out experiments in a timely manner, write up development reports; work with downstream team members to maintain the PD downstream labs in a professional working environment.
Responsibilities
60% Working in the lab to perform experiments described above in the job primary duties.

20% Design the experiments, discuss the experimental plan, analyze the data, and provide a summary and further suggestion.

Identify, design and implement a new idea/ technology to the downstream processes.

10% Prepare the process development reports and tech transfer documents

10% Prepare the presentation in either team meeting or various project meeting.
Requirements
Ph.D. in biochemistry, chemical engineering, or related discipline with at least 3-5 years of meaningful industry experience or MS in biochemistry, chemical engineering, or related discipline with over 6-8 years of industry experience is required.
Generally has 3-5 years of downstream process development experience of the biologics, such as viral vectors, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, and therapeutic recombinant proteins in the biopharma industry is required.
Deep knowledge and understanding of downstream process of biologics is required.
Hands-on experience of AKTA HPLC or equivalent system is required.
Laboratory automation or statistical analysis of large data sets is highly preferred.
Experiences of large scale GMP manufacturing and GXP compliant documentation is highly preferred.
Experience of process characterization/ validation is plus.
Strong scientific publication record and/or patent filing is plus.
Working knowledge and skills for viral vector or vaccine purification is a plus.
Competencies
Strong organizational skills and detailed documentation abilities is required.

• Work independently in hands-on laboratory setting, self-motivated to learn and develop new techniques

• Perform multiple tasks simultaneously, keep accurate records, follow instructions, and comply with company policies.

• Excellent writing and verbal communication skills is required.

• Teamwork a must.

• Must be comfortable in the fast-paced, multi-tasking biotech environment.

• On a regular basis, the PD Downstream Sr. Scientist needs to work closely with PD Downstream Lead to design and execute various experiments, including complex and large-scale processes.

• Strong data organization skills, interpretation and troubleshooting are critical to be successful; New experiments should be designed based on available experimental data and scientific hypothesis; and executed the following experiments on time.
