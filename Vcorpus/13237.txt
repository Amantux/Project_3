The Role


We need your help in building the next generation of machine learning at SurveyMonkey. We want to help our customers make great decisions from the millions of survey responses we receive daily. To do that well, we'll need to use applied machine learning that include natural language processing, classification, spam detection, personalization / ranking, etc. We also need to do this at scale and in real-time whenever possible.

Successful candidates will have built these types of systems before and deployed them to production. Specifically, we need someone that is ready to get their hands dirty with building out a flexible machine learning platform that supports scalable model training in-memory or through distributed computational processing (single vs. multi-node), model deployment, API management, and constructing elegant feedback loops for self-sustaining machine learning systems. Candidates will need to be well-versed in large-scale data storage and processing and have the judgement to know when to use out-of-the-box solutions versus building custom ones. Being fun to work with is also a heck of a bonus.

Requirements:
At least + years professional software engineering experience using a high level language (Python preferred).
Experience utilizing big data and machine learning technologies (e.g. H2O, Spark, Hadoop, Cassandra).
Very comfortable with Unix/Linux operating systems. We favor Ubuntu.
Strong communication and documentation skills.
Experience with operating computational clusters for training machine learning models.
Familiarity with the ipython notebook, pandas, sklearn, numpy and nltk.
Familiarity with machine learning techniques and natural language processing (e.g. featurization, n-gram analysis, supervised classification and unsupervised topic clustering, etc).
Nice to Have:


Experience with ETL pipelines.
Has interest and is excited by data modeling, data science of lots of structured and unstructured data.
At SurveyMonkey, we offer competitive salaries, medical/dental benefits, PTO, 401k, paid holidays and parental leave, and equity compensation.

SurveyMonkey is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.
