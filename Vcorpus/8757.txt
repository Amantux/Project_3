One Concern is a startup which specializes in Artificial Intelligence for Natural Disasters. With our team of global disaster scientists and engineers, we have developed a platform that helps emergency responders prepare for and make the most critical decisions during the first moments of a crisis, with the main goal of saving lives.

We are looking for an Earthquake/Structural Engineering expert also experienced in machine learning to join our team at One Concern. This role will work on development and improvement of machine learning models designed for our earthquake module. You will be identifying new useful data sources, envisioning creative applications of machine learning and building models to improve damage prediction due to earthquakes on structures.

We work in a highly collaborative, challenging and exciting environment. Our engineering challenges are unique, so you should be comfortable stepping in uncharted territory and excited to create systems that can scale to all disasters and geographies. If you are problem solver, think out-of-the-box, love challenging yourself, and want to work for a cause, we would love to have you at One Concern.

We are committed to a workplace that reflects the community we serve. We especially encourage women, people of color, and others who are underrepresented in the tech industry to apply.
