Our mission at Climate is to help all the world's farmers sustainably increase their productivity by building a digitized platform where every farmer is able to optimize and flawlessly execute every decision on the farm. Achieving this vision demands revolutionizing agriculture through technology. Agriculture adoption of GPS, sensors, imaging and state-of-the art precision equipment has enabled the creation of computer generated prescriptions for farmers’ fields. The agricultural transformation from simple, mechanical based operations to complex computer based systems is possible because of data science & analytics. The digital revolution in agriculture rivals past technology changes such as mechanization, hybrid seeds, and biotechnology. There has never been a greater demand for your skills in agriculture.

Position Overview:

We are seeking a highly motivated professional who shares our passion for innovation in the area of predictive analytics and artificial intelligence to join our Corn modeling team within the Science organization. You will have the opportunity to be on the forefront of developing novel & complex integrated agronomic models for recommendations on Products, Seeding Rate, Fertility and Crop Protection that farmers need today. Our team has access to the Rich and Big data you’ve only dreamed about to drive creation of simple, predictive, prescriptive models that will shape the future of the agriculture industry. We work on hard problems because we love the challenge. As part of our diverse, highly dynamic group, you will work side-by-side with a team of exceptional data scientists with diverse backgrounds (Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, Engineering, Physics etc..) to foster your career growth and development, while delivering next-generation scientific breakthroughs. If you are passionate about addressing feeding a growing planet, doing this sustainably by having a direct impact for farmers, the Climate Corporation would love to talk to you!

A Data Scientist plays a key role in delivering innovative scientific breakthroughs by applying predictive analytics, risk optimization and statistics to integrated recommendations. You will work closely with interdisciplinary scientists, domain experts and stakeholders to predict the product performance and provide personalized prescriptions for growers while developing novel analytical models and best practices for complex data analyses.

What You Will Do:

Design and prototype models that integrate artificial intelligence techniques, optimization, and statistics in order to solve challenging analytics problems influencing farmer decisions using scalable models

Leverage heterogenous data across the growing season(s) (Soil, weather, agronomics, equipment, imagery and real-time sensors) to prescribe optimal products & seeding rates, fertility and crop protection practices

Solve computational challenges of scaling complex AI algorithms on big data with engineer partners

Implement quantitative, empirical, geospatial statistical methodology to characterize and predict how products will respond across diverse farmer fields

Basic Qualifications

PhD or Masters plus 2 years of experience in Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Engineering, or a related discipline with a focus on using predictive analytics, artificial intelligence and/or optimization to influence real life decisions

At least one year experience with applying quantitative research (e.g. artificial intelligence) in optimizing human decisions

Familiarity with multiple regression techniques, multivariate analysis, mixed models

Ability to communicate complex ideas in a clear, precise and actionable manner

Strong computational skills in Python

Preferred Qualifications:

Knowledge and experience in farming, plant breeding or physiology, agronomy or genetics

Proven experience using multiple forms of AI such as machine learning, deep learning, tensor flow, neural networks or predictive analytics to drive decisions using new algorithms efficiently and rigorously
