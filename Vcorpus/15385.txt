Summary
The process development team is seeking a highly motivated, detail-oriented Formulation Senior Scientist. As a member of our dedicated PD team she/he will play a key role in drug product development to support formulation, fill/finish process and cryopreservation development for early and late stage. This position will require hands-on lab work and project responsibilities. Responsibilities include development and optimization of drug product formulations, as well as execution of characterization and stability studies. The candidate must have biopharmaceutical industry experience to develop, optimize, and characterize formulation processes, good knowledge of tangency flow filtration (TFF) technologies. Experiences on development of DS and DP, including experiences/knowledge of vials and stoppers selection and final fill and finish process are highly desirable. The major responsibilities are described, but not limited to, as follows:

• Support formulation, fill/finish process and cryopreservation development for early and late stage.

• Design and execute targeted DS and DP formulation studies to support formulation development of AAV vectors with the appropriate lines to secure the needed analytical characterization support.

• Perform the high throughput screen to optimize the robust and scalable final formulation operation.

• Support external/ internal manufacturing process and participate troubleshooting as needed.

• Maintain GXP compliant good documentation, close-out experiments in a timely manner, write up development reports; work with downstream team members to maintain the PD downstream labs in a professional working environment.
Responsibilities
60% Working in the lab to perform experiments described above in the job primary duties.

20% Design the experiments, analyze the data from the experiments, and provide the summary and further direction.

10% Prepare the process development reports and tech transfer documents.

10% Prepare the presentation in either team meeting or various project meeting.
Requirements
• Ph.D. in biochemistry, chemical engineering, or related discipline with at least 3-5 years of meaningful industry experience or MS in biochemistry, chemical engineering, or related discipline with over 6-8 years of industry experience is required.

• Experience in formulation and fill/finish process development for gene therapy and/or biological molecules is required.

• Experience with rAAV drug product manufacturing, formulation and cryopreservation process is preferred.

• Deep knowledge of TFF techniques, hands-on product stability testing experience is preferred. Good understanding of Freeze Drying/ Lyophilization of biologics is plus.

• Experiences of large scale GMP manufacturing and GXP compliant documentation is plus.

• Strong scientific publication record and/or patent filing is plus.

• Working knowledge and skills for viral vector or vaccine purification is a plus.
Competencies
• Strong organizational skills and detailed documentation abilities is required.

• Work independently in hands-on laboratory setting, self-motivated to learn and develop new techniques

• Perform multiple tasks simultaneously, keep accurate records, follow instructions, and comply with company policies.

• Excellent writing and verbal communication skills is required.

• Teamwork is a must.

• Must be comfortable in the fast-paced, multi-tasking biotech environment.

• On a regular basis, the Formulation Development Senior Scientist needs to work closely with the senior PD leaders and PD Downstream Lead to design and execute various experiments, including complex and large-scale processes.

• Strong data organization skills, interpretation and troubleshooting are critical to be successful; New experiments should be designed based on available experimental data and scientific hypothesis, and executed the following experiments on time.

• Demonstrate independent problem-solving skills of technical issues; develop solutions to a variety of moderate to complex problems.

• Exercise judgement within defined procedures and practices to determine appropriate action
