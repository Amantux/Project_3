As a Data Scientist at SentiLink, you will be responsible for developing and maintaining our core product: models that identify fraudsters and synthetic identities.

This is a full-stack data science role, involving model development, analysis, and writing tested, production-quality code. Candidates should have previous data science work experience and be interested in a fast-moving company where deep domain understanding drives development.
