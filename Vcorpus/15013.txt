Preventable illnesses still kill tens of thousands of people every year, however there is hope. Through vaccines, public health prevention programs and data intelligence, the impact of the flu, pneumonia, measles, whooping cough, cervical cancer, and many more diseases is diminished. The battle is fought every day to ensure that communities are prepared, proactive, and empowered for any event or outbreak from bioterrorism and newly emerging disease, such as COVID-19, to the old diseases that never left.
Make an impact and join us in this fight at the front lines.
