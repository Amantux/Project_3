HHS Technology Group is a valued and trusted systems integration partner for several departments within a number of State Governments. The intense growth and tremendous financial forecast we are experiencing at HHS Technology Group can largely be attributed to our successes on these initiatives and having been awarded the NASPO Value Point Contract (a consortium that shortens the procurement process for technology solutions whereby 22 states have opted in) (reference: https://www.naspovaluepoint.org/portfolio/mmis-provider-services-module-2018-2028/hhs-technology-group/).

HHS Technology Group is accelerating state government technical solution delivery by leveraging a pre-built universal blockchain-powered platform, UniBloc. Unibloc comes readily bundled with modules and algorithms for membership, consensus, API management, and Peer2Peer communication that correspond with block chain frameworks.

HHS Technology Groupâs flagship product, Discover your Provider (DyP) is a provider relations/provider enrollment solution. Components of this modular software can be re-purposed or built upon to deliver cloud based technical web services solutions.

Discover your Data (DyD) is a product that uses augmented analytics that leverage enabling technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence to assist with data preparation, insight generation and insight explanation in order to augment how healthcare organizations explore and analyze their data. This new platform helps HTGâs clients, including state Medicaid agencies, obtain crucial insights into providersâ quality of performance, compliance and behavior, and enables them to boost the efficiency and effectiveness of medical service delivery to members and patients.

Further, the âœDyDâ analytics platform will assist healthcare organizations in managing the transition from fee-for-service payments to value-based contracting, while also detecting and minimizing fraud, waste and abuse.
