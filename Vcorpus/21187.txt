Situated in Stanford's
highly dynamic research environment, the Moding Laboratory
(modinglab.stanford.edu), led by Everett Moding, MD, PhD is seeking a Bioinformatician/Research
Data Analyst 1 to manage and analyze high throughput sequencing and clinical
data from cancer patients under the direction of
project researchers and investigators. The
Moding Laboratory performs translational cancer research by analyzing human
tissue and blood samples with next-generation sequencing. Using a combination
of state-of-the-art computational and experimental techniques, we aim to
identify critical mediators of treatment resistance that can be validated in
preclinical models and targeted to enhance the efficacy of cancer therapy. The
Moding laboratory is administratively situated within the Stanford University
School of Medicineâ€™s Department of Radiation Oncology. As an NCI-designated
Comprehensive Cancer Center the Stanford Cancer Institute is a dynamic and stimulating
place to work as it maintains the highest level of scientific rigor,
institutional support and coordination for the complete range of cancer-related
research, including basic, translational, clinical and population-based
science.
Duties include:

Collect, manage and clean datasets.
Employ new and existing tools to
interpret, analyze, and visualize multivariate relationships in data.
Create databases and reports,
develop algorithms and statistical models, and perform statistical analyses
appropriate to data and reporting requirements.
Use system reports and analyses to
identify potentially problematic data, make corrections, and determine root
cause for data problems from input errors or inadequate field edits, and
suggest possible solutions.
Develop reports, charts, graphs and
tables for use by investigators and for publication and presentation.
Analyze data processes in
documentation.
Collaborate with faculty and
research staff on data collection and analysis methods.
Provide documentation based on
audit and reporting criteria to investigators and research staff.
Communicate with government
officials, grant agencies and industry representatives.
Develop machine learning and image
processing software for research.
