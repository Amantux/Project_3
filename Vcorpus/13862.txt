Groupon, Inc. is looking for a Data Scientist to join our team in Seattle, WA.

We're a "best of both worlds" kind of company. We're big enough to have resources and scale, but small enough that a single person has a surprising amount of autonomy and can make a meaningful impact. We're curious, fun, a little intense, and kind of obsessed with helping local businesses thrive. Does that sound like a compelling place to work?

How you'll spend your day:
You will design and build scalable computing systems for collecting, integrating, and processing large sets of structured and unstructured data from disparate sources and feed the results of the computations to other downstream systems within established service level agreement timeframes;
Work closely with peers from the product, engineering, and data science teams to form good hypotheses on how to improve the business;
Design, execute and measure experiments to test these hypotheses;
Productionalize solutions that show lift;
Build cutting edge systems to analyze, clean, and derive insights from data;
Work with product management and engineering and operations teams to develop KPIs for new features and instrumentation to quantify the adoption of new product initiatives;
Create product scorecards for teams and managers to track product performance, business impact and discover opportunities;
Design both the business logic and the technical specifications to extract key data elements from a data warehouse;
Research and develop machine learning models for data analysis;
Utilize distributed system tools to manage and manipulate data from data warehouses;
Apply programming languages to develop and deploy models and software applications into production;
Quantify the value of existing product improvements or the potential value of new product hypotheses;
Up to 5% travel required.
Were excited about you if you have the following requirements:
Bachelors degree in Analytics, Engineering or related field plus 1 year related experience.
Any level of experience with researching and developing machine learning models for data analysis.
Any level of experience with utilizing distributed system tools to manage and manipulate data from data warehouses.
