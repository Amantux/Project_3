About Our AI/ML Team

Our mission is to build the best model-driven businesses. To do this, we make investments in industries where machine learning can be the most transformative. Beyond our initial investments, we give our portfolio companies a meaningful edge by helping them acquire and integrate incumbent businesses in order to enable such transformation. Essential to this approach is our Foundry team of experienced product managers, engineers, data scientists, and other specialists who take an active role to help portfolio companies execute on transformation initiatives while supporting our investment team with industry research and due diligence.

After an investment, you will partner with our portfolio companies combining their domain expertise with your ML knowledge to instrument their workflows, build representative datasets, and deploy trained models. All of these actions will be taken with an eye towards the goal of iterative, data-driven transformation of our portfolio companies while retaining and growing the strengths that were the basis of the original investment.
