We have a highly successful record of hiring, challenging, and retaining talented researchers from diverse academic backgrounds. Individuals interested in conducting innovative research with real-world impact seem to enjoy and excel at the types of problems we like to solve.

PDT Researchers work in small, nimble teams where merit and contribution, not seniority, drive the discussion. We strive to foster an intellectually challenging environment that encourages collaboration and innovative ideas.
