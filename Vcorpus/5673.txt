Pharmacy Investigators and Consultants, a leading firm dedicated to anti-fraud deterrence programs in health care, is seeking an entry level data scientist to maintain our two proprietary, highly sophisticated data analytics tools: COPSTM (used to score health care claims for fraud) and CARsTM (an on-line portal for pharmacies to provide information for fraud auditing). The candidate should have excellent coding skills in Python as well as HTML, R, Spark, jQuery, SQL, PHP and MySQL. The ideal candidate must be comfortable working independently on the development and maintenance on our proprietary systems, COPSTM and CARsTM , with little to no supervision. While three to five years’ experience is highly desirable, it is not required. A Master’s Degree in Data Science, Computer Science, Statistics or related degree is required with a strong programming background. The candidate will work closely with existing clinical and criminologist staff and combine the candidate’s coding and statistical and analytical skills and knowledge to form a dynamic and client-centric team.

Salary is open based on experience, but we aim for a highly competitive level of compensation with benefits. The position is open immediately. The Data Scientist will enjoy a diverse team environment with highly motivated and skilled team members. While some travel to the Northwest Chicago suburbs would occasionally be required for training, this position will not require daily commuting.
