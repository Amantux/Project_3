The U.S. Army Research Laboratory Computational and Information Sciences Directorate, DOD Supercomputer Resource Center, conducts research critical to the Army's assured land power dominance into the deep future. We work with emerging computational platforms and architectures, advanced algorithms, new programming models, immersive visualization tools, virtual/augmented reality, machine/deep learning, and related areas. Our facilities include high performance computers, emerging processors, development platforms, neuromorphic processors and accelerators, and a 2-D/3-D and immersive visualization lab. 

Parsons is seeking highly motivated, self-starting individuals to develop big data analytic capabilities for ARL and its customers, such as the acquisition and test & evaluation communities. Datasets are high dimensional, high volume, and highly heterogeneous. The individual will work with Army scientists and engineers to understand the data domain and current practices, while at the same time thinking outside the box and using their mathematical/statistical modeling expertise to develop next generation analytic workflows. The individual will work with team members and incorporate their models, and insights derived from those models, to develop user-facing visual analytic prototypes. 

As a data science team member, you will:

 

 Work with a multi-disciplinary team

 

 Investigate new algorithms and novel approaches for analyzing large scale and heterogeneous datasets

 

 Apply mathematics and statistics for the analysis of structured and unstructured data

 

 Work with research teams to customize solutions to meet research, analysis and customer objectives

 

 Prepare and present research findings at scientific seminars, conferences and workshops

 

 Publish technical reports and refereed journal articles
