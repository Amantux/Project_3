About the Role

As a Data Scientist on the Financial Products team, you'll take an active role in shaping and implementing the product data science agenda across a global set of financial services and payment experiences; including the Uber visa card and digital wallet. The team is at the intersection of consumer experiences, payments, and our core ridesharing and Eats businesses. You will be interacting with product, design, marketing, engineering, and partnerships to propose insights into how to enhance and grow Uber’s financial products strategy. In addition to these cross-functional partnerships, you will also play a key role in driving collaborative relationships with data scientists and analysts across Uber’s varied data teams.

What you'll do

Leverage data to build models and conduct analyses to shape the financial products strategy and product roadmap. Models are used to enhance our understanding of user behavior, predict future performance of new cohorts, and personalize products to better target users for new or existing financial products.

Work closely with multiple product managers as thought partners across the rider, driver, and Eater domain space.

Generate hypotheses for exploratory analysis that will shape new initiatives and provide recommendations for actions.

Perform time-series analyses, hypothesis testing, and causal analyses to statistically assess impact and extract trends for the team. Projects range from analyzing fully randomized research designs to utilizing more advanced techniques to elicit causality in the absence of a clean experimental setup.

Design experiments and interpret the results to draw detailed and actionable conclusions across a variety of key performance indicators.

Create data pipelines to transform raw application data into a format usable for analysis with the use of SQL and open-sourced pipelining tools.

Create dashboards and reports to regularly communicate experimental results, adhoc deep dives, and monitor key metrics to internal and external stakeholders.

Present findings to the financial products team, the data science community, and Uber’s senior management to inform business decisions.

Collaborate with cross-functional teams like product, engineering, operations, and marketing, finance, growth, and more.

What you'll need

Minimum 4 years of experience in a quantitative analysis role with emphasis on statistics

BA/BS/MS in Math, Statistics, Engineering, Computer Science, or another quantitative field. Advanced degrees are a plus, and candidates with a research background in the Social Sciences are also encouraged to apply (Economics, Political Science, etc).

Excellent SQL skills, advanced Excel skills, and proficiency with Python or R for statistical analysis in order to work at scale with truly big data sets.

Advanced knowledge of experimentation, statistical methods, and machine learning techniques.

Ability to deliver on tight timelines and move quickly while maintaining attention to detail.

Work closely with cross-functional teams to execute on decisions.

Self-driven with the ability to work in a self-guided manner with minimal oversight, but knows when to ask for help.

Superb communication, collaboration, and organizational skills with a general love of problem solving.

Enthusiasm for disruption and an appetite to overcome challenges, internal and external, as you will be changing the way the world gets from point-a to point-b.

About the Team

We’re a team that operates out of Uber’s San Francisco and Palo Alto offices, and coordinates efforts with our global technology teams in Amsterdam and Bulgaria. As a member of our team, you will dig into the complex but rewarding world of financial services, payment experiences, and ship innovations across the globe. The team manages a portfolio of products that includes the Uber Cash, Uber Visa Card, Visa Local Offers, Uber Rides with (Amex) Platinum, and Uber Gift Cards (more in the works).
