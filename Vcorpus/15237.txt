Overview

As a Quantitative Researcher, you will join a team of PhD-level analysts dedicated to the data-driven development and improvement of our trading models at SIG. Our quants apply their problem-solving skills and mathematical creativity to create solutions in today’s competitive and constantly changing financial markets. Our team comes from a variety of backgrounds; before joining us at SIG, many of our researchers were recognized for their accomplishments through fellowships, grants, academic competitions, and publications in refereed research journals.

At SIG, Quant Researchers spend most of their time on the trading floors, seated side-by-side with fellow quants, traders, and technologists. This enables our quants to be highly involved in the day-to-day discussions that shape our trading activities and transform quantitative methods into trading opportunities. Because of this collaborative and dynamic environment, Quantitative Researchers are able to directly see both the applications of their results and the impact of their work.

What we're looking for
Graduating PhD students or postdoctoral researchers in quantitative fields such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, or Operations Research
Exceptional problem-solving skills
Solid communication skills, both in the ability to understand others and to make yourself clearly understood
Strong, practical computing skills; a specific language proficiency is less important than your ability to get computers to accomplish tasks efficiently and reliably
Experience working on in-depth research projects
Finance experience is a plus, but not required
Visa sponsorship is available for this position
