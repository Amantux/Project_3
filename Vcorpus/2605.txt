Who we are

At Criteo, we connect 1.5 billion active shoppers with the things they need and love. Our technology takes an algorithmic approach to predict what user we show an ad to, when, and for what products. Our dataset is about 50 petabytes in Hadoop (more than 120 TB extra per day) and we take less than 10ms to respond to an ad request. This is truly big data and machine learning without the buzzwords. If scale and complexity excite you, join us.

You will contribute to building and improving the precision of our prediction models (such as CTR/CR prediction or user engagement scoring), gather and analyze data to extract valuable information.

In a team of 3-5, you will be working closely with your mentor to drive your project, design and ensure best practices are applied.

You will participate in all knowledge sharing sessions/ workshops.

You will gain a better understanding of the development cycle and work on real and impactful projects that are used by leading retailers and brands.

You are encouraged to actively voice your ideas whilst learning how to build and ship quality prediction models into production which will likely affect millions of users instantly.

You will work with and learn from talented engineers, with a diverse set of backgrounds.
