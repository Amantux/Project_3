We believe that a great writing experience is fast, outcome-focused, and alive with your ideas. Going from start to finish on a document in three minutes. Knowing who will respond to anything you've written before you even press send. Writing software that puts your ideas at the center, with language that is certain to land the way you want. Textio has already changed the way that thousands of companies write and now we are looking for a creative and curious data scientist with a passion for modeling to join us.

In this role you will help us improve the quality of Textio's current genre-defining models and you will create the new models that will power Textio's future products. You will work with a top-notch team of data scientists, engineers, product managers, and others to turn Textio's rich linguistic data into user-facing products that provide a unique balance of predictive power, model introspection, and user guidance. Your influence will span from data cleaning/curation to model development to the systems and processes that we use to evolve and deploy our models.

You will be joining a welcoming and collaborative data science team at a company that deeply understands the value of data. Textio is a phenomenal place to build, learn, experiment, and deliver impact as a data scientist. Come join us!

What you'll be doing:

Iteratively improving the predictive power and the quality of user guidance generated by Textio's current user-facing models, and extending this work into new domains to support future products

Continuously assessing and communicating model quality through intrinsic metrics (e.g. accuracy) and extrinsic metrics (e.g. measures of customer experience)

Curating the datasets that Textio uses to train and evaluate our models, using domain knowledge to inform your choices

Collaborating with Textio's data platform engineers to evolve the systems, processes, and abstractions that Textio uses to train, test, and ship models to production

Contributing analytical expertise wherever it is most needed to move Textio forward: customer-facing products, internal data products, and ad-hoc analysis

Strengthening Textio's data science and related teams through mentorship, partnership, and technical leadership

We'd love to hear from you if:

You have experience building interpretable models that blend predictive power and explainability

You have shipped a variety of predictive models into production, and from this experience you have developed a point of view on model experimentation and shipping practices

Your work is guided by business context and data constraints with a bias for practicality and simplicity

You take a data-centric approach to modeling. You build a deep understanding of your data and problem domain and draw on this context to iteratively test hypotheses that improve your models

You have a demonstrated history of mentorship and technical leadership. You enjoy investing time into the growth of your colleagues

You are comfortable working in ambiguous problem spaces, but you can map out a path to increased clarity and independently take concrete steps along this path

You thrive in an environment that believes that prototypes speak louder than specs

You take pride in the things you create

You demonstrate a track record of trying and learning new things

You're able to communicate your point of view but are low ego

We want to work with awesome and innovative people who can help us use data to make Textio the best that it can be.

Textio embraces diversity and equal opportunity in a serious way. We are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. The more inclusive we are, the better our work will be. If there is anything we can do to create a more comfortable interview experience for you, please let us know.
