Turning Point Therapeutics is a clinical-stage precision oncology company with a pipeline of internally discovered investigational drugs designed to address key limitations of existing cancer therapies. The companyâ€™s lead program, repotrectinib, is a next-generation kinase inhibitor targeting genetic drivers of non-small cell lung cancer and advanced solid tumors. Turning Point Therapeutics is building their drug discovery pipeline of precision medicines and are driven to develop therapies that mark a turning point for patients in their cancer treatment.

We are seeking a highly motivated scientist to join our experienced drug discovery and development team where you will make critical contributions to the discovery and development of oral small molecule drugs that will transform cancer therapy. The successful candidate will be responsible for the performance of a variety of ADME studies to better understand the drug-like or pharmacodynamic properties of our molecules; these include developing and performing bioanalytical LC/MS/MS methods for pharmacokinetic studies; kinetic and thermodynamic solubility assessment, permeability analysis, pre-formulation, and metabolite ID studies, and communicating and presenting results to others. This is a hands-on position that requires an ability to work both independently and as part of a multidisciplinary team in a dynamic and rapidly evolving environment.

Desired Skills and Experience:
Ph.D. in biochemistry, analytical chemistry, pharmacology or a related field with at least 10 years of relevant education and experience in a pharmaceutical industry ADME laboratory
The candidate must have a strong knowledge of drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics principles and experience in applying ADME concepts and principles to drug discovery and development
Practical experience performing in vitro ADME analyses, enzyme assays and developing bioanalytical LC/MS/MS methods (TOFs, Q-Traps, Orbitraps, etc.), HPLC, laboratory automation, cell culture methods and applying them to cellular and animal studies
Experience in PK and PK/PD analysis and use of relevant software like WinNonlin
Hands-on experience with GRAS excipients and their use in pre-formulation to support preclinical PK and safety assessment studies
Experience compiling appropriate data and writing pharmacokinetic sections of IND submissions
Excellent interpersonal, organizational, written and oral communication skills with an attention to detail
Ability to think creatively and be a team player
Flexibility with a willingness to work on multiple projects simultaneously
Demonstrated capability to mentor and manage junior scientists
Duties and Responsibilities:
Planning and performing in vitro ADME studies; plasma protein binding, CYP inhibition, CYP induction, metabolic stability, reaction phenotyping, in vitro drug metabolism using microsomes and hepatocytes, to identify potential new drug candidates and support the development of clinical-stage drug candidates.
Work collaboratively to support oncology drug discovery programs
Source, procure, install, qualify, operate, and maintain instrumentation and equipment required for ADME studies, as needed.
Publish work in peer-reviewed journals and present work both externally and internally
Managing the conduct of in vitro and in vivo testing at CROs
Research and implement new technologies as needed.
Present updates at department and project team meetings
Familiarity with regulatory recommendations for evaluation of interactions of drug candidates with small molecule transporters.
