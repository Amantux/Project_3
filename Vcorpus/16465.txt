Airtime Product

We are a user-centered product team passionate about disrupting the status-quo in the current Social space.

Airtime provides a new way for users to share experiences together that lets them truly `Be Together` and `Do Things Together` as they would in real life. We are looking for a data scientist who shares our passion for the space and would help us bring this audacious vision to fruition.

You will be expected to blend in your concrete data driven understanding of product metrics with qualitative feedback and business goals to come up with actionable insights to drive product strategy. The areas you will be involved in include: how users interact with rooms, in video chats, our messaging model, and our user experience focused on the "being together" and "doing things together" mantra of experiencing the internet in a new way.
