Data Scientist, Research Associate - 16487

NATURE OF WORK

The Department of Biostatistics and Informatics (B&I) seeks a full-time doctoral trained data scientist to integrate systems immunology data with clinical data, identify novel disease-specific biomarkers with diagnostic and therapeutic applications, and conduct associated statistical analyses. This faculty position has been created in collaboration with the Anschutz Medical Campus’ Human Immunology and Immunotherapy Initiative (HI3) and the Center for Innovative Design and Analysis (CIDA). These are two campus wide initiatives with a mission to transform new data sources into biomedical knowledge. The work place is professional and dynamic with immense learning and growth potential. This person will join a growing group of Masters (10+) and Doctoral trained (9+) collaborative and consulting data scientists and biostatisticians.

The Research Associate is a key research-faculty position in the Department and CIDA. It is similar to team science track faculty positions at other institutions. A Research Associate is expected to provide high-level, professional and scientifically rigorous analytic development and support through CIDA and HI3. They are expected to become a significant contributor to HI3, partnering to define and shape the analytic infrastructure and methods used in CIDA and HI3. Specific to this position, the individual is expected to work with high-dimensional multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) data. The ideal candidate will be expected to use and develop modern toolkits including, but not limited to, Python, R, MATLAB, and Github to both validate and develop data processing and data analysis pipelines. Depending on the particular collaborations interesting independent research opportunities may arise; although it is not the emphasis of the position.

PROFESSIONAL FIELD

Data science, Computer Science, Biostatistics, Bioinformatics, Computational Biology

SUPERVISION RECEIVED

The Research Associate will be supervised by the CIDA Director and indirectly by the HI3 director.

SUPERVISION EXERCISED

This position may have supervisory responsibilities with graduate Research Assistants seeking MS degrees (RAs) and Professional Research Assistants (PRAs).

EXAMPLES OF WORK PERFORMED

The faculty in the Department of Biostatistics and Informatics and CIDA collaborate with health researchers from nearly every School and Department at CU Anschutz on their biomedical and health research projects. The person in this position will work collaboratively with bioinformatics, engineers, other investigators in HI3 to anticipate long-term data needs and plans for solutions eventually developing into a leader in the analysis of MIBI data and other new technologies. They are expected to be known across the campus and regionally for their specific area of data analytic expertise. This individual will also create, program and operate data management pipelines and develop best-practice protocols for storing, backup and organization of research data, and create pipelines that implement these practices including standardized quality control pipelines for ensuring data integrity. They will work with faculty to transfer data from the public repositories and organize these data to facilitate data analysis, develop analysis pipelines to convert raw data into analysis ready formats, and coordinate, develop, and deploy data processing and image analysis tools specific to individual projects.
