Janssen Research & Development, L.L.C., a Johnson & Johnson company, is recruiting for a Principal Scientist, Computational Genomics, in our Population Analytics group, to be located at our Spring House, Pennsylvania campus in the United States.

At the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, we are working to create a world without disease. Transforming lives by finding new and better ways to prevent, intercept, treat and cure disease inspires us. We bring together the best minds and pursue the most promising science.

We are Janssen. We collaborate with the world for the health of everyone in it. Learn more at www.janssen.com and follow us @JanssenGlobal. Janssen Research & Development, LLC is part of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies.

Janssen Pharma R&D seeks an innovative scientist with expertise in creatively applying quantitative analysis to large-scale population-based studies as well as real-world data to advance our pharmaceutical and/or biomedical research, drug discovery and development agenda. We seek an individual with strong training and experience in applied quantitative methods and a track record of scholarship. Candidates should possess outstanding communication skills as well as broad biological interests that will enable them to facilitate interactions between laboratory-based scientists in our Therapeutic Areas.

He/she will be part of the Computational Sciences group in the Discovery Sciences organization within Janssen Parma R&D. He/she will be a member of the Population Analytics team within Computational Sciences which aims to bring together researchers within and outside of Janssen with expertise in human disease genetics, genetic epidemiology, computer/computational science, high performance computing, population/statistical genetics, genomics etc.

The mission of the Population Analytics team is to support longitudinal, population-based studies to increase understanding and facilitate the search for therapies that prevent, intercept or cure disease. They will be responsible for integration, analysis and interpretation of data collected on various cohorts and across geographical/time scales. They will decipher causal factors such as genes, the environment and an individual's lifestyle that will facilitate the discovery of novel targets, biomarkers and pathways implicated in disease. This remains an extremely challenging problem, which we expect these researchers to address with the goal of using biomedical data to build a best-in-class target identification and validation engine (TIDVALE) to feed our pipeline.

Role & responsibilities:

• Provide expertise in the analysis of genotype/phenotype data from longitudinal, population and/or targeted cohort-based studies that consider individual variability in genes, environment and lifestyle and leverage the knowledge gained to increase understanding of disease.

• Establish and optimize AI/ML algorithms incorporated within computational pipelines on a wide range of computing platforms. The aim is to deploy the tools necessary to translate genotype/phenotype data from large population-based cohorts and targeted studies to help our researchers identify or validate potential therapeutic targets, pathways and biomarkers implicated in disease.

• Develop processes to efficiently integrate and analyze a variety of high-dimensional data, including electronic health record, biosensor/imaging, and multi-omics data from the UK Biobank. Apply predictive modeling approaches to these data in order to further translate findings from genomics analyses, addressing questions of interest in our therapeutic areas and facilitating interactions between colleagues across the organization.

• Act as scientific partner and subject matter expert in collaborations with internal and external partners.

• Supervise, guide and mentor junior scientists and postdoctoral fellows and in general act as an expert scientific leader to support and nurture collaborations with internal and external partners to build our TIDVALE.

• Perform and publish high-quality research relevant to the mission of the organization; effectively communicate data and results to our stakeholders within and outside of J&J and work effectively with colleagues across J&J sectors.

Qualifications

• A M.D. and/or Ph.D. in computer/computational sciences, biomedical sciences, engineering, data science, bioinformatics, or mathematics/statistics is required.

• Deep expertise in large-scale computing is required.

• A minimum of 7 or more years post-graduate experience in data analytics in the physical, computing or biomedical sciences with expertise in high performance computing is preferred.

• Strong computational skills and demonstrated ability to work with a group of scientists to deliver on objectives in defined timelines is required.

• Experience with drug discovery and development practices and project support in a large pharmaceutical setting is a preferred.

• Independent, self-motivated, innovative and able to excel in a goal-oriented, multifaceted and fast-moving team environment are required.

• Outstanding communication, organizational and leadership skills, with a successful track record of publication and collaboration with cross-functional scientific teams is required.

• The role will require up to 20% domestic/international travel. The role will be based in our Spring House Pennsylvania campus in the United States.
