What you'll do...

Build complex data sets from multiple data sources, both internally and externally. Conduct advanced statistical analysis to determine trends and significant data relationships. Build learning systems to analyze and filter continuous data flows and offline data analysis. Train algorithms to apply models to new data sets. Validate models and algorithmic techniques. Scale new algorithms to large data sets. Combine data features to determine search models. Research new techniques and best practices within the industry. Utilize system tools including (MySQL, Hadoop, Weka, R, Matlab,ILog). Develop multiple custom data models to drive innovative business solutions. Translate business needs into data requirements. Collaborate with cross-functional partners across the business. Interpret data to identify trends to go across future data sets. Collaborate with project teams to implement data modeling solutions. Develop models of current state in order to determine improvements needed. A Staff Data Scientist is responsible for analyzing large data sets to develop multiple custom models and algorithms to drive innovative business solutions. Staff Data Scientists work on large project teams in order to provide analytical support and guidance to an assigned area on for large projects (for example, email targeting, business optimization, consumer recommendations) within Walmart eCommerce. Staff Data Scientists are responsible for building large data sets from multiple sources in order to build algorithms for predicting future data characteristics. Those algorithms will be tested, validated, and applied to large data sets. Staff Data Scientists are responsible for training the algorithms so they can be applied to future data sets and provide the appropriate search results. Staff Data Scientists are responsible for researching new trends in the industry and utilizing up-to-date technology (for example, HBase, MapReduce, LAPack, Gurobi) and analytical skills to support their assigned project. Staff Data Scientists are the subject matter experts for statistical analysis and modeling for their project team.
