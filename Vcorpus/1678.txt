Data Scientist
Our Data Scientists perform research and analysis that allows the company to make optimal product decisions.

Because we are such a data-driven company, our data scientists play a central role in the product development process by uncovering key insights from our data. As a data scientist, you will work closely with product managers, product designers, and engineers to devise appropriate measurements and metrics, design randomized controlled experiments, build visualizations, and tackle hard, open-ended problems that uncover usage patterns and opportunities for the company. You may also develop tools and infrastructure to scale and automate the analyses that enable rapid product iteration. We have a wide range of rich data, giving you ample room for exploration and creativity. Examples of some projects our data scientists have worked on include modeling our long-term growth, improving the relevance and personalization of the homepage feed, and exploratory factor analysis of user behavior.

B.S., M.S., Ph.D. in a scientific or quantitative field
