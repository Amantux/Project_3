About Wambi:
Founder, Alex Coren created Wambi out of an unyielding need to bring human connection back to the center of patient care. Both personally and professionally, Alex spent time immersed in hospital settings, where care providers were rarely appreciated. It became apparent that this was leading to high burnout rates, and strongly affecting the quality of their care. To address this Alex leveraged technology to recognize and reward care providers in real-time with feedback obtained directly through the eyes of patients and their families. With her passion for technology, and commitment to compassion, Alex has been able to grow Wambi into the thriving startup that it is today.
Founded in 2016, Wambi, delivers a patient-driven healthcare employee performance and reward platform aimed at recognizing and empowering compassionate care. Through its gamified digital platform informed by real-time patient feedback, care providers are armed with their individual data as a means to promote autonomy and inspire behavioral change.
