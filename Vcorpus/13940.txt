Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is an international humanitarian organization that delivers impartial medical care to people affected by conflict, epidemics, disasters, or exclusion from health care in over 70 countries.

We welcome candidates who bring a wide variety of backgrounds and experiences to join us in working toward MSF’s common mission.

Department

The Field Human Resources Department (Field HR) is responsible for recruitment, selection, placement, and retainment of qualified and well-suited field staff to meet the growing needs of MSF field operations.

Project

The People Analytics project aims to support and strengthen data utilization amongst MSF’s global Human Resources (HR) teams so that HR planning is more strategic and data-driven. The project acts as an internal resource for HR teams so that they can leverage the power of data science to support decision-making and strategies around recruiting, retaining, placing, developing and administering policy and programs for MSF’s workforce of ~45,000 people around the world.

Under the direction of the Head of People Analytics, the Data Scientist will help identify opportunities for data-driven solutioning in HR and will be the focal point for the technical aspects of the team’s work. By Data Scientist we mean a practiced statistician that is also fluent in programming methods, open-source technologies and some basic data engineering. The successful candidate has a proven ability to apply simple and complex statistical theories and methods to explore, infer and predict, in addition to the ability to efficiently and rigorously explore data sources, build tools and manage data quality. Using this combination of skills, the Data Scientist will help us uncover information and extract meaning from the data available to support data-driven decision-making on MSF’s workforce and HR activities. The ideal candidate is energetic, patient, proactive, organized and passionate about Data Science and how it can be used to for social good and to positively influence organizations and people operations.
