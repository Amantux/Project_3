Role Summary/Purpose

The CV scientist position is with computer vision team developing image, video and 3D data understanding algorithms that detect components and defects as relevant to inspection activities of large industrial assets. This is an exciting position to observe and contribute on how cutting-edge vision technologies such as SLAM, Deep-learning and Geomatics are used as part of a very ambitious product that predict and represent health of large assets such as power distribution lines, refineries and solar farms by exploitation of data collected by moving platforms such as drones and or streamed from fixed sensors.

Essential Responsibilities

The Staff Computer Vision Scientist will work closely with Computer Vision Scientists and Engineers to rapidly build, test and iterate the analyses and models to create high-fidelity automated classification, detection, and prediction solutions. Contribute to the ongoing efforts to use Deep Learning techniques for analyzing large datasets of BHGE’s customers across industry verticals. Apply advanced analytics and machine learning techniques for tagging, classification, and automated feature and object recognition in images, video streams and/or 3D data.

In the role of the Staff Computer Vision Scientist, you will:

Build computer vision tools to associate different modalities of data to asset baselines by means of data understanding and registration

Investigate and apply image analytics and deep learning approaches for automated and assisted analysis of data from various industrial datasets. Data sources include RGB, multi-spectral imaging, radiographs, thermographs, LIDAR, ultrasonic and sonar scans

Data preparation, cleaning and large scale experimentation as needed to build solutions

Collaborate with cross-functional teams across multiple offices and regions

Qualifications/Requirements

Bachelor’s Degree in Computational Science from an accredited college or university

Minimum three years of experience in Computer Vision and/or Deep Learning

Desired Characteristics

Master’s Degree in Computational Science from an accredited college or university

Excellent software design and programming skills in object oriented paradigm

Fluent with frameworks and languages such as Tensorflow, Keras, Python, OpenCV, VXL, PCL, DLIB, scikit-learn

2-3 years of post-graduate industry experience

Production-level developer in Python, C/C++, or Java

Experience with analytics development for industrial applications in a commercial/industrial setting

Excellent organizational, interpersonal, communication

Location

Boston, MA 02210

This is your opportunity to learn more, do more, live the career you have imagined and be part of a truly diverse organization.
