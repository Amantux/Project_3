Data Scientist helps develop software and processes that can be used for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning application. In close collaboration with the business and métiers, the data scientist offers mathematical and statistical models from the collected data to augment, improve or speed up human decisions within the Oil & Gas sector. With Schlumberger Data Scientists will be given the opportunity to apply their expertise and deploy sophisticated data science solutions at scale on real-world problems, supporting many areas of Schlumberger’s business and work on application in cloud.

Roles and Responsibilities:

Attends seminars and online training as required for professional and business needs.

Ensures that the basic MBO cycle (Job description, SOP, quarterly performance review, SLP3, objectives, etc) is implemented for everyone including himself and for those under his/her supervision.

Manages personal development and keeps current on technology advances within the domain of Data Science.

Data Scientist will be in charge of research and delivery of Proof of Concepts solutions, responding to clear and specific business needs. Extra scope of the role includes project management, data preparation, data analysis, model development and fundamental research in the domain of Artificial Intelligence.
