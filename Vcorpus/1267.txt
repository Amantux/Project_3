ENERGY INDUSTRY TRANSFORMATION

The trillion dollar energy industry is undergoing a disruptive transformation. Energy generation is going from centralized to decentralized. Utilities are shifting from vertically integrated power producers and distributors (think PG&E; SoCal Edison) to nimbler energy services providers operating in increasingly deregulated environments. New generation assets are smaller in scale, distributed, powered through renewable sources, and owned by the customers. This shift will lead to over $10 Trillion in new energy investments by 2040. With this dramatic change, energy providers must run their business in new ways. Energy providers of the future will be data-driven, where effective use of data will determine who wins and who loses.

Enter AutoGrid

AutoGrid's suite of Energy Internet applications allows utilities, electricity retailers, renewable energy project developers and energy service providers to deliver cheap, clean and reliable energy by managing networked distributed energy resources (DERS) in real-time and at scale. The AutoGrid platform and applications leverage petabytes of smart meter, sensor and third-party data, along with powerful data science, artificial intelligence, network optimization and high performance computing algorithms to monitor, predict, optimize and control the operations of millions of assets connected across global energy networks. Energy companies worldwide use AutoGrid's software to improve their operations, integrate renewables and drive deeper engagement with their customers.
