PRIMARY PURPOSE OF POSITION Apply the scientific method to extract knowledge and insights from data, which may take the form of time-series (smart-meters, smart-grid, and other IoT), structured (relational data stores), and unstructured (text and multi-media) data sets. Leverage multiple sources and types of data, including smart meter data, to develop analytic solutions/use cases for driving actionable intelligence, improving operational efficiencies, and enabling consistent achievement of performance metrics. Key areas of focus for use case development will include but are not limited to theft of electric service/energy diversion, high meter read rate achievement, power quality, electric safety, effective smart meter operation/communication, and revenue leakage. Closely collaborate with various internal stakeholders, information architects, data engineers, project/program managers, and other teams to turn data into critical information to inform decision making. This requires understanding business needs, providing and receiving regular feedback, and planning the proper transfer of developed solutions. Mine big and small data for insights, using advanced statistic and machine learning methods. Validate findings with the business by sharing analysis outputs in a way that can be understood by business stakeholders. Become a subject matter expert in the areas of artificial intelligence, machine learning, feature engineering, data mining, and data manipulation/storage. Demonstrate commitment to continuous learning and professional development in technical subject matter. Share knowledge with team members, and business stakeholders, and IT partners. Collect, cleanse, standardize and analyze data from a variety of internal and external sources. Produce novel insights to help inform business actions using statistical modeling and machine learning techniques on complex data-sets on the order of several terabytes or petabytes. Position requires working extended hours, including 24 x 7 coverage during storms or other energy delivery emergencies. PRIMARY DUTIES AND ACCOUNTABILITIES 1. Develop key predictive models that lead to delivering a premier customer experience, operating performance improvement, and increased safety best practices. Develop and recommend data sampling techniques, data collections, and data cleaning specifications and approaches. Apply missing data treatments as needed. 2. Analyze data using advanced analytics techniques in support of process improvement efforts using modern analytics frameworks, including – but not limited to – Python, R, Scala, or equivalent; Spark, Hadoop file system and others. 3. Access and analyze data sourced from various Company systems of record. Support the development of strategic business, marketing, and program implementation plans. 4. Access and enrich data warehouses across multiple Company departments. Build, modify, monitor and maintain high-performance computing systems. 5. Provide expert data and analytics support to multiple business units. 6. Works with stakeholders and subject matter experts to understand business needs, goals and objectives. Work closely with business, engineering, and technology teams to develop solution to data-intensive business problems and translates them into data science projects. Collaborate with other analytic teams across Exelon on big data analytics techniques and tools to improve analytical capabilities.
