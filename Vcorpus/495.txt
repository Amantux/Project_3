A trusted partner. A national resource. A leader in national security space. We are THE Aerospace Corporation. A team that takes pride in our readiness to solve some of the most complex technical challenges in existence. With challenges spanning clandestine to commercial, you’ll have the unique opportunity to work on projects that are literally evolving our nation's space and launch capabilities. We all share a common passion and aspiration – to serve a mission much bigger than ourselves. When you join our team, you’ll be part of a rare collection of thought leaders and game-changing innovators. Are you ready to launch your career?

Responsibilities

Our group studies the use of data science to attempt solving engineering problems that we thought were impossible to solve. We are pushing the limits of the achievable to meet the theoretically possible and we are looking for engineers and computer scientists that are passionate about the field of machine learning to join our team.

Team Platypus Aerospace (Google us) is growing and looking for curious minds that are not afraid to ask what if? Can you design a radio using neurons instead of traditional communication algorithms? Can you create an adversarial neural network attack or create a classifier that is robust to state-of-the-art attacks? Can you detect anomalies on a satellite bus or a telecommunication system? Can you find image patterns where everyone else can’t? We have a group of experienced engineers and data scientists that are actively working on these real-world problems.

We are looking for engineers with a solid theoretical background and knowledge of the latest trends in machine learning concepts and architectures. To work in our group, you need to be extremely hands-on: we go beyond analysis and simulation to build working intelligent ML prototypes. You also need to be excited about exploring fields and concepts that may be out of your comfort zone.

Let’s do it!

***This role can be filled as an Aerospace Sr. Member of Technical Staff or Engineering Specialist***

Key Functions

Work in an engineering team whose main objective is to build intelligent radios

Experience in Data Science which includes: data-centric problem formulation, data cleaning hands-on experience as well as classification, regression and reinforcement learning knowledge
