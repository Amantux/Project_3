We are looking for a top-tier product analyst to work with our Growth team in our Mountain View office. This role will partner closely with a team of analysts, data scientists, developers, designers, and product managers to run experiments against millions of users. Atlassian is experiencing rapid growth, so there are plentiful chances to create impact for the team.

You're probably someone who loves finding patterns amidst chaos and is passionate about user behavior. You'll be working teams who are well-versed in statistical concepts and high-velocity experimentation.

On the first day, we'll expect you to have

4-7 years of experience using data to build software at industry-leading companies

Experience in designing and analyzing experiments that drive key product decisions

Familiarity with event-based analytics, and a curiosity to learn more

Expertise in SQL and proficiency in another data programming language (Python, R, etc.)

Proficiency in one or more analytics & visualization tools (e.g., Tableau, Mode, etc.)

Ability to work comfortably with a command line interface

Great communication to share analyses and recommendations to non-technical audiences and executives

Proven sense of accountability, self-drive, and the ability to function independently

It's great, but not required, if you have

Experience in both enterprise (or B2B) as well as consumer (or B2C) environments

Experience working in a global environment with remote teams

An advanced degree in a quantitative discipline, such as statistics, mathematics, economics, or computer science

We're also always looking for excellent written and verbal communication skills, a great eye for detail, and a sense of humor.
