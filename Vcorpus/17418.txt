PulsePoint Data Engineering team plays a key role in our technology company that's experiencing exponential growth. Our data pipeline processes over 80 billion impressions a day (> 20TB of data, 220 TB uncompressed). This data is used to generate reports, update budgets, and drive our optimization engines. We do all this while running against extremely tight SLAs and provide stats and reports as close to real-time as possible.

The most exciting part about working at PulsePoint is the enormous potential for personal and professional growth. We are always seeking new and better tools to help us meet challenges such as adopting proven open-source technologies to make our data infrastructure more nimble, scalable and robust.
