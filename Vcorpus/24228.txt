Isle Utilities is a boutique technology and innovation consultancy with Global headquarters in the UK and US headquarters in Palo Alto, CA. Isle aims to accelerate the commercialization of disruptive emerging water technologies. We do this through two core capabilities, through our Technology Approval Group (TAG) – a unique innovation forum for global water utilities, and our consultancy service for end users.

Isle has worked on behalf of utilities to identify, screen, and qualify emerging solutions and best practices that provide a step change solution to all aspects of utility management, including optimization and performance, master planning, organizational strategic planning, and execution of capital improvement plans. As an independent third party, Isle works hard to objectively source and screen technology providers, which are prioritized based on water utility clients expressed needs and interest areas. We facilitate this support through the TAG program, a core distinction of the Isle brand that has been in operation since 2005, as well as our tailored consultancy services.

To support the continued growth of the North American division of Isle, we are currently seeking a candidate that can drive new business into Isle’s consultancy practice and technology scouting efforts that serve primarily water utilities, municipalities, special districts, and agencies.
