Read what people are saying about working here. 
Do you love discovering insights that drive business value, and transform how work is done? Are you creative, ambitious, and enjoy teaching others about how data science can significantly improve their decision-making?

We are passionate about transforming how our business runs by fully exploiting Data Science and algorithms to improve our understanding of the consumer, use of media, and effectiveness of retail. P&G has a 180+ year legacy of transforming how it and the CPG industry functions, and Data Science is foundational to our next transformation. Are you up for the challenge?

Do you enjoy designing enterprise level research and analytic frameworks? How would you like to turn on your creative genius and problem-solving alongside business leadership? If this sounds like fun, we are looking for someone with your skills and abilities.

You will be using Big Data and advanced analytics to direct the engagement of our business leaders and end to end automate historic work processes. You will be collaborating actively across functional partners to accomplish various project objectives. We need someone who can source new data types, develop new algorithms to tackle unique problems, and ultimately automate successful capabilities for robust operations.

You will get your hands dirty in the data and algorithm development, using artificial intelligence and analytic tools (R, Python, Scala, Spark, Hadoop, KNIME, etc.) to unlock business building insights on a tera/petabyte scale. You will need to be adept at demonstrating such technologies for solving ad hoc business problems, innovating on potential future solutions, and working with technology partners to translate your innovations into robust, scaled, analytic solutions applied to retail problems.

At P&G, Data Scientists are Business Leaders . An effective communicator, self-motivated, and able to drive insights into actions that improve P&G’s business results. Your Business knowledge, interpersonal/communication skills are therefore a requirement to thrive in a multi- functional leadership team.

Your analytic skills are the foundation of this role. The ability to mine mountains of data, derive actionable insights, and then translate those insights into business improving action is essential in our work. You will need to be the primary evangelist to the business for the power of predictive analysis and develop business cases to illustrate the potential for change in decision-making that occurs when you begin to anticipate what will happen, versus just reflecting on what has occurred. Your Qualifications

Our leaders are pursuing or have graduated with a PhD in Statistics, Applied Mathematics, Economics, Computer Science, Data Science, Business Analytics, Operation Research, Software Development, or a similar quantitative field.
