People who use data to solve hard problems. Including ones that did not exist a few years ago. We believe a mix of data, analytics, automation and responsible AI can widen the range of what humans can do and improve American democracy. As a consultant to federal agencies, we change how our country operates. By providing the right training and tools, we encouraged our people to go outside their comfort zone.
