Read what people are saying about working here. 

Under direct supervision, the Data Scientist applies professional bioinformatics concepts and computational procedures to complete small projects or portions of projects. Works on assignments of limited scope and complexity. Follows standard programming procedures to analyze situations and data from which answers can be readily obtained.

The successful applicant will work with the Principal Investigator (PI) and senior members of the laboratory under direct supervision in implementing and testing algorithms and models for data analysis, providing data visualization of analyzed results, for various ongoing life sciences projects. The successful applicant will use professional bioinformatics concepts, and assist in additional analyses as needed to achieve research objectives.

MEDICINE / CARDIOLOGY / ARNAOUT LABORATORY

The Arnaout laboratory studies deep and machine learning methods for biomedical imaging and related clinical data, with the goals of decreasing diagnostic error and developing and scaling novel phenotypes to drive precision medicine research.

UCSF is a top-10 medical center and a leader in cross-campus efforts to mine, harmonize, and analyze multi-modal clinical data for the University of California’s 15 million patients.

The Arnaout laboratory is part of both the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute, where the abovementioned efforts are based, and the nationally ranked Department of Medicine. Projects focus on deep learning for medical imaging, and through collaborative work with intra- and inter-institutional partners, touch the electronic health record, genetics, and other sources of data.
