**Summary:**  
  
Marketing Science R&D is an interdisciplinary team of data scientists focused on research that improves measurement and ads delivery on our platform. The team's expertise spans domains, including causal inference, survey methodology, machine learning, cryptology, location and identity prediction algorithms. We develop methodologies, design and prototype solutions, and partner with our engineering and product colleagues to scale these solutions such that millions of advertisers can benefit.
  
We're looking for researchers and data scientists with expertise in cryptology that can develop new technologies to securely receive, handle, and process data that is collected through various channels on and off Facebook. Team members will pursue deep technical knowledge of signals, identity, network and measurement systems at Facebook, and research new frameworks such that we can advance the state of advertising and measurement while maintaining a focus on security and privacy principles.
  
**Required Skills:**  
  
1. Research opportunities to leverage new data sources, systems, or technologies to improve data security, user privacy or ads measurement
  
2. Design and develop prototypes with scalable validation frameworks for ongoing evaluation
  
3. Work both independently and build cross-functional relationships with Engineering, Product and Analytics to shape long-term product roadmaps with a balance of technical rigor and strategic considerations
  
4. Learn new tools, systems and languages -quickly- as required by the particular project you are working on
  
5. Apply communication skills to engage diverse audiences on technical topics and nuanced insights
  
**Minimum Qualifications:**  
  
6. PhD in Computer Science, Engineering, Cryptography or related field, or a Master's within one of these fields combined with 3+ years of hands-on research experience in the internet, financial services, payments, security, or advertising industry architecting and implementing security features and solutions
  
7. Experience in Python and Presto, Hive or Spark SQL
  
8. Programming and scripting experience in a Linux environment to develop scalable research prototypes using at least one of: Bash, C/C++, Java, JavaScript or PHP
  
9. Experience designing and implementing analytical and/or algorithmic solutions, tailored to particular business needs and tested on large data sets
  
10. Experience with at least two of the following core security concepts:
  
11. Privacy enhancing technologies, e.g. data minimization and management, data anonymization, differential privacy
