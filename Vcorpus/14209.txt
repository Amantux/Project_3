You’re passionate about a zero-emissions future and want to build something special. You want to own your space but work with talented, like-minded people on important projects. The pace doesn’t scare you; it excites you. Quality and integrity matter to you.

We feel exactly the same way.

Drive Forward. Introduce yourself to us and let’s start a conversation. We’re currently on the lookout for a Senior Thermal Modeling Engineer to join our Aerothermal Engineering team. You will be responsible for the development and validation of 1D models of the vehicle's thermal systems.

You Will:
Develop and validate 1D models of the vehicle's thermal systems in Simcenter Amesim
Contribute to the development and optimization of the vehicle's thermal architecture
Optimize and size thermal components, including e-compressor, evaporators, condensers, refrigerant lines, pumps, valves, hoses, radiators, etc. to meet vehicle performance requirements
Collaborate with thermal testing and validation engineers to develop validation test plans for thermal components to determine if they meet design requirements
Work with controls engineers to ensure that BMS and TMM control schemes will meet thermal requirements
Work with suppliers to ensure that all thermal components meet design requirements, as dictated by 1D and 3D analyses
You Have:
A Ph.D. in mechanical, aerospace, chemical or nuclear engineering
Must have: Graduate research work focused on development, optimization, and modeling of refrigeration or cryogenic cycles or a specific component of refrigeration cycles
Experience with 1D modeling commercial software including Simcenter Amesim or MATLAB Simulink
Hands-on experience with setup, testing, and validation of refrigeration cycles
Experience with optimization methods
This position is not eligible for CPT or OPT.
